BEssus, the KING has made a fair hand on it, has ended the wars at a blow, would my sword had a close basket hilt to hold wine, and the blade would make knives, for we shall have nothing but eating and drinking.
We that are commanders shall doe well enough.
Faith Bes. such cōmanders as thou may, I had as live set thee Perdue for a pudding yth dark, as Alexander the great.
I love these jests exceedingly.
I think thou love them better then quarrelling Bess•s, He say so much ythy behalf, and yet thou art valiant enough upon a retreat, I think thou would kill any man that stopped thee, and thou could.
But was not this a brave combat Mardonius?
Why, did thou see it?
You stood with me.
I did so, but me thought thou wi•kst every blow they struck.
Well, I believe there are better Soldiers then I, that no•er saw two Princes fight in lists.
By my troth I think so too Bessus, many a thousand, but c•rtenly all that are worse then thou •aue •even as much.
T was brauel• done of our King.
Yes, if he had not ended the wars, I am glad thou dare talk of such dangerous businesses.
To take a Prince prisoner in the heart of his own Country in single combat.
See how thy blood cruddles at this, I think thou would be contented to be beaten in this passion.
Shall I tell you truly.
I.
I could willingly venture for it.
Um, no venture neither good Bessus.
Let me not li•e, if I doe not think it is a braver piece of service, then that •me so famed for.
Why art thou famd for any valour?
I famed, I, I warrant you.
I am very heartily glad on it. I have been with thee ever since thou came ath' wars, and this is the first word that ever I heard on it, prithee who fems thee?
The Christian world.
Tic heathenishly done of them, in my conscience thou deferu'st it not.
Yes, I ha done good service.
I doe not know how thou moist waite of a man in's Chamber, or thy agility in shifting a trencher, but otherwise no service good Bessus.
You saw me doe the service your self.
Not so hasty sweet Bessus, where was it, is the place vanished.
At Bessus desperate redemption.
Bessus desperate redemption, wher's that.
There where I redeemd the day, the place bears my name.
Prithee who christened it.
The Soldier:
If I were not a very merely disposed man, what would become of thee: one that had but a grain of collar in the whole composition of his body would send thee of an arrand to the worms, for putting thy name upon that field: did not I beat thee there yth head, a'th troupes with a trun∣chion, because thou would needs run away with thy com∣pany,
when we should charge the enemy.
True, but I did not run.
Right Bessus, I beat thee out on it.
But came not I up when the day was gone, and re∣deemed all?
Thou know, and so doe I, thou mean to fly, and thy fear making thee mistake, thou rinsed upon the enemy, and a hot charge thou gau'st, as Isle doe thee right, thou art surious in running away, and I think we owe thy fear for our victory. If I were the King, and were sure thou would mistake always, and run away upon the enemy, thou should be General by this light.
You'll never leave this till I fall foul.
No more such words dear Bessus: for though I have ever known thee a coward, and therefore durst never strike thee; yet if thou proceedst, I will allow thee valiant, and beat thee.
Come, come, our King's a brave fellow.
He is so Bessus, I wonder how thou come to know it: But if thou were a man of understanding, I would tell thee he is vain-glorious, and humble, and angry, and patient, and merry, and dull, and joyful, and sorrowful, in extremities in an hour: Doe not think me thy friend for this, for if I cared who knew it, thou should not hear it Bessus: here hee is with the prey in his foot.
Thy sadness  takes away
From my fall victory; am I become
Of so small fame, that any man should grieve
When I overcome him: They that placed me here,
Intended it an honour large enough
For the most valiant living; but to dare
Oppose me single, though he lost the day,
What should afflict you, you are free as I,
To be my prisoner, is to be more free,
Then you were formerly; and never think
The man I held worthy to combat me,
Shall be used seruilly: Thy ransom is
To take my only sister to thy wife;
A heavy one Tigranes: for she is
A Lady that the neighbour Princes send
Blanks to fetch home: I have been too unkind
To her Tigranes, she but nine year old,
I left her, and ne'er saw her since: your wars
Have held m• long, and taught me, though a youth,
The way to victory: she was a pretty child
Then, I was little better; but now fame
Cries loudly on her, and my Messengers
Make me believe she is a miracle;
Sheele make you shrink as I did, with a stroke
But of her eye Tigranes.
Is it the course of
Iberia, to use their prisoners thus?
Had Fortune thrown my name aboue Arbaces,
I should not thus have talked: for in Armenia
we hold it base; you should have kept your temper,
Till you saw home again; where tic the fashion
Perhaps to brag.
Bee you my witness Earth:
Need I to brag, doth not this captive Prince
Speak me sufficiently, and all the Acts
That I have wrought upon his suffering Land?
Should I then boast? Where lies that foot of ground
Within his whole Realm, that I have not past
Fighting, and Conquering? Far then from me
Be oftentation: I could tell the World
How I have laid his Kingdom desolate
With this sole arm, propped by Divinity,
Stripped him out of his glories, and have sent
The pride of all his youth to people graves,
And made his Virgins languish for their loves;
If I would brag, Should I that have the power
To teach the Neighbour world humility,
Mix with vain glory.
In deed this is none?
Tigranes, no; did I but take delight
To stretch my deeds as others doe on words,
I could amaze my hearers▪
So you doe:
But he shall wrong his, and my modesty
That thinks me apt to boast: After an Act
Fit for a God to doe upon his foe,
A little glory in a Soldiers mouth,
Is well becoming, bee it far from vain.
Its pity that valour should be thus drunk.
I offer you my Sister, and you answer,
I doe insult: A Lady that no suit
Nor treasure, nor thy Crown could purchase thee,
But that thou faughst with me.
Though this bee worse
Then that you spoke before, it strikes not me
But that you think to ouer-grace me with
The marriage of your Sister, troubles me,
I would give worlds for ransoms were they mine,
Rather then have her.
See if I insult
That am the Conqueror, and for a ransom
Offer rich treasure to the conquered,
Which he refuses, and I bea•e his scorn.
It cannot be self flattery to say,
The daughters of your Country set by her
Would see their shame; run home, and blush to death
At their own foulness, yet she is not fair,
Nor beautiful, those words express her not,
They say her looks are something excellent,
That wants a name yet: were she odious
Her birth deferues the Empire of the world.
Sister to such a Brother, that hath tan
Victory prisoner, and throughout the Earth
Carries her bound; and should hee let her loose,
She durst not leave him. Nature did her wrong
To print continual conquest on her cheeks,
And make no man worthy for her to take,
But me that am too near her; and as strangely
She did for me: But you will think I brag.
I doe Isle be sworn. Thy Valour and thy passions severed, would have made two excellent fellows in their kinds: I know not whether I should be sorry thou art so va∣liant, or so passionate▪ would one of um were away.
Doe I refuse her that I doubt her worth▪
Were she as virtuous as she would be thought,
So perfect, that no own of her own sex
Would find a want, had she so tempting fair,
That she could wish it off her damning souls,
I would pay any Ransom, twentytimes,
Rather then meet her married in my bed:
Perhaps I have a Love, where I have fixed
Mine eyes, not to bee moved, and she on me▪
I am not fickle:
Is that all the cause?
Think you, you can so knit your self in love
To any other, that her searching sight
Cannot dissolve it? So before you tried
You th ught your self a match for me in fight:
Trust me Tigranes she can doe as much
In peace, as I in War; sheele conquer too
You shall see, if you have the power to stand
The force of her swift looks, if you dislike,
Isle send you home with love, &amp; name your ransom
some other way: but if she bee your choice
She frees you: to Ileria you must.
Sir, I have learnt a Prisoners sufferance,
And will obey, but give me leave to talk
In private with some friends before I go.
Some two await him forth, and see him safe,
But let him freely send for whom he please,
And none dare to disturb his conference:
I will not have him know what bondage is 
Till he be freefrom me. This Prince Mardonius
Is full of wisdom, Valour, all the graces
Man can receive.
And yet you Conquered him?
And yet I conquered him, &amp; could have don
Had thou joined with him, though thy name in Arms
Bee great; Must all men that are virtuous
Think suddenly to match themselves with me:
I conquered him, and bravely; did I not?
And please your Majesty I was afraid at first.
When were thou other?
Of what?
That you would not have spied your best advantages, for your Majesty in my opinion lay too high me thinks, un∣der favour, you should have lain thus.
Like a Taylor at a vvake.
And then, left please your Majesty to remember, at one time, by my Troth, I wished my self with you.
By my Troth thou would have sunk um both out oath lifts.
what to doe?
To put your Majesty in mind of an occasion; you lay thus, and Tigranes falsified a blow at your leg, which you by doing thus avoided; but if you had whipped up your leg thus, and reached him on th'eare, you had made the blood run abouts head.
what contry-fence-schoole did thou learn that at?
Puffed, did I not take him nobly?
Why you did, and you have talked enough on it.
Talk enough,
while you confine my words, by Heaven and Earth,
I weremuch better bee a King of Beasts
Then such a people: If I had not patience
Aboue a god, I should be called a Tyrant
Throughout the World. They will offend to death
Each minute: Let me hear thee speak again
Andthou art earth again: why this is like
Tigranes speech▪ that needs would say, I bragged.
Bessus hee said I bragged.
Ha ha ha.
Why dost thou laugh?
By all the world I me grown ridiculous
To my own subjects: Tie me to a chair
And jest at me, but I shall make a start
And punish some, that other will take heed
How they are haughty; who will answer me?
He said I boasted, speak Mardonius,
Did I? He will not answer: O my Temper!
I give you thanks aboue, that taught my heart
Patience, I can endure his silence; what will none
Vouchsafe to give me audience, am I grown
To such a poor respect or doe you mean
To break my wind, speak, speak soon one of you▪
Or else by Heaven,
So please your,
Monstrous,
I cannot bee heard out, they cut me off
As if I were too saucy; I will live
In woods, and talk to Trees they will allow me
To end what I begin. The meanest Subject
Can find a freedom to dis harge his soul,
And not I, now it is a time to speak,
I harken.
May it please,
I mean not you,
Did not I stop you once? but I am grown
To balke, but I desire, let another speak.
I hope your Majesty,
Thou draw thy words
That I must waite an hour, where other men
Can hear in instants; throw your words away
Quick, and to purpose, I have told you this.
An't please your Majesty:
Wilt thou devour me? this is such a rudeness
As yet you never showed me, and I want
Power to command me, else Mardonius
Would speak at my request; were you my King,
I would have answered at your word Mardonius,
I pray you speak, and true y, did I boast?
Truth will offend you.
You take all great care what will offend me,
When you dare to utter such things as these.
You told Tigranes, you had won his Land
With that sole arm propped by Divinity:
Was not that bragging, and a wrong to vs
That daily venturoe lives?
O that thy name
Were great as mine, would I had paid my wealth,
It were as great, that I might combat th•e;
I would through all the Regions habitable
Search thee, and having found thee, with my Sword
Drive thee about the world, till I had met
Some place that yet mans curiosity
Hath mist of; there, there would I strike thee dead:
Forgotten of Man•end, such Funeral Rites
As Beasts would give thee thou should have
The King
Rage▪ extra•mely, shall wee flinke away;
Heel strike vs:
Content.
There I would make you know t'was this sole arm,
I grant you were my Instruments, and did
As I commanded you, but t'was this Arm
Moved you like wheels, it moved you as it pleased:
whither slip you now? what are you too good
To waite on me? I had need have temper
That rule such people; I have nothing left
At my own choice, I would I might be private:
Mean men enjoy themselves, but tic our curse,
To have a tumult that out of their loves
will waite on vs whether we will or no;
will you be gone? why here they stand like death,
My word moos nothing.
Must we go?
I know not.
I pray you leave me Sirs, I'm proud of this,
That they will be entreated from my sight:
why now they leave me all: Mardonius,
Sir.
will you leave me quite alone? me thinks
Civility should teach you more then this,
If I were but your friend: stay here, and waite.
Sir, shall I speak?
why you would now think much
To bee deni•e, but I can scarce entreat
what I would have: doe, speak.
But will you hear me out?
with me you article to talk thus: well
I will hear you out.
Sir, that I have ever loved you, my sword hath spo∣ken for me, that I doe, if it bee doubted, I dare call an oath a∣great one to my witness: and were you not my King, from amongst men, I should have chose you out to love aboue the rest:nor can this challenge thanks: for my own sake I should have doted, because I would have loved the most deserving man, for so you are.
Alas Mardonius, rise, you shall not kneel;
we all are Soldiers, and all venture lives:
And where there is no difference in men's words,
Titles are jests: who can out value thee?
Mardonius thou hast loved me, and hast wrong,
Thy love is not rewarded, but believe
It shall be better, more then friend in arms,
My Father, and my Tutor, good Mardonius.
Sir, you did promise you would hear me out.
And so I will, speak freely, for from thee
Nothing can come but worthy things and true.
Though you have al this worth, you hold some qualities that doe eclipse your virtues.
Eclipse my virtue•?
Yes your passions, which are so manifold, that they appear even in this: when I commend you, you hug me for that truth: when I speak of your faults, you make a start, and fly the hearing: but,
when you commend me? O that I should live
To need such commendations: If my deeds
Blew not my praise themselves aboue the earth,
I were most wretched: spare your idle praise:
If thou did mean to flatter, and should utter
words in my praise, that thou thoughtst impudence,
My deeds should make um modest: when you praise,
I hug you; it is so false, that were thou worthy
Thou should receive a death, a glorious death
From me: but thou shalt understand thy lies,
For should thou praise me into Heaven, and there
Leave me enthroned, I would despise thee though
As much as now, which is as much as dust,
Because I see thy envy.
How ever you will use me after, yet for your own promise sake hear me the rest.
I will, and after call unto the winds,
For they shall lend as large an ear as I
To what you utter: speak.
would you but leave these hasty tempers, which I doe not say take from you all your worth, but darken um, then you would shine indeed.
Well.
Yet I would have you keep some passions, least men should take you for a god, your virtues are such.
Why now you flatter.
I never understood the word, were you no King, &amp; free from these wilde moods, should I choose a companion for wit and pleasure, it should bee you, or for honest▪ to en∣terchange my boss•me with, it would be you; or wisdom to to give me counsel, I would pick out you: or valour to defend my reputation, still I would find out you, for you are fit to fight for all the world, if it could come in question: Now I have spoke, consider to your self, find out a use? if so, then what shall fall to me is not material.
Is not material: more then ten such lives
As mine Mardonius: it was Nobly said,
Thou hast spoke truth, and boldly, such a truth
As might offend another. I have bin
Too passionate, and idle, thou shalt see
A swift amendment: But I want those parts
You praise me for: I fight for all the world:
Give thee a Sword, and thou wilt go as far
Beyond me, as thou art beyond in years,
I know thou dare, and wilt; It troubles me
That I should use so rough a phrase to thee,
Impute it to my folly, what thou wilt,
So thou wilt pardon me; that thou and I
Should differ thus.
why it is no matter Sir:
Faith but tic, but thou dost ever take
All things I doe thus patiently, for which
I never can requite thee but with love,
And that thou shalt bee sure of. •thou and I
Have not bin merry lately: pray thee tell me
where had thou that same jewel in thine care?
why at the taking of a Town.
A wench upon my life, a wench Mardonius
Gave thee that Iewe•l.
wench, they res•ect not me, Ime old and rough, and every limb about me, but that which should grows stiffer: lth those businesses I may swear I am t•uely honest: for I pay justly for what I take, and would bee glad to be at a certainty.
why doe the wenches incroch upon thee?
I by this light doe they.
Did thou sit at an old rent with um?
Ye• faith.
And doe they im•rooue themselves?
I, ten shillings to me, every new young fellow they come aequainted with.
How can live on it?
Why I think I must petition to you.
Thou shalt take um up at my price.
Your price?
I at the Kings price.
That may be more then I am worth.
Is he not merry now?
I think not.
He is, he is, weal show our selves.
Bessus I thought you had been in Iberia by this, bad you• ha•te▪ Gobrias will want entertainment for me.
An't please your Majesty•e I have a suit.
First not lousy Bessus, what i•t?
I am to carry a Lady with me.
Then thou hast two suits.
And if I can prefer her to the Lady Panthan your Majesties sister, to learn fashions as her friends term it, it will be worth something to me.
So many nights lodgings as tic thither, will not?
I know not that, but gold I shall be sure of.
Why thou shalt bid her entertain her from me, so thou wilt resolve me one thing.
If I can.
Faith tic a very disputable question, yet I think thou can decide it▪
Your Majesty has a good opinion of my vnderstan∣ding.
I have so good an opinion of it: it is whether thou be valiant.
Some body has traduced me to you: doe you see this sword Sir?
Yes.
If I doe not make my back-biters eat it to a knife within this week, say I am not valiant.
Health to your Majesty.
From Gobrias?
Yes Sir.
How does he, is he well?
In perfect health.
Thank thee for thy good news,
A trustier servant to his Prince there lives not
Then is good Gobrias.
The King starts back.
His blood goes back as fast:
And now it comes again.
He alters strangely.
The hand of Heaven is on me, be it far
From me to struggle; if my secret sins
Have pulled this curse upon me, lend me tears.
Enough to wash me white, that I may feel
A childlike innocence within my breast;
Which once performed, O give me leave to stand
As fixed as constancy her self, my eyes
Set here vnmou'd, regardless of the World,
Though thousand miseries encompass me.
This is strange, Sir, how doe you?
Mardonius my mother:
Is she dead?
Alas, shees not so happy; thou dost know
How she hath laboured since my Father died
To take by treason hence this loathed life,
That would but be to serve her, I have pardoned
And pardoned, and by that have made her fit
To practise new sins, not repent the old;
She now has hired a slave to come from thence
And strike me here, whom Gobrias sifting ̇out,
Took, and condemned, and executed there
The carefulst servant: Heaven let me but live
To pay that man; Nature is poor to me,
That will not let me have as many deaths
As are the times that he hath saved my life,
That I might die um over all for him.
Sir let her bear her sins on her own head,
Vex not your self.
What will the world
Conceive of me? with what unnatural sins
Will they suppose me laden, when my life
Is sought by her that gave it to the world?
But yet he writes me comfort here, my sister
He says is grown in beauty, and in grace,
In all the innocent virtues that become
A tender spotless maid: she staines her cheeks
With mourning tears to purge her Mothers ill,
And amongst her sacred dew she mingles prayers,
Her pure oblations for my safe return:
If I have lost the duty of a son,
If any pomp or vanity of state
Made me forget my natural offices;
Nay farther, if I have not every night
Expostulated with my wandering thoughts,
If ought unto my Parent they have erred,
And called um back: doe you direct her arm
Unto this foul dissembling heart of mine:
But if I have been just to her, send out
Your power to compass me, and hold me safe
From searching treason; I will use no means
But prayers: for rather suffer me to see
From mine own veins issue a deadly flood,
Then wash my dangers off with Mothers blood:
I ne'er saw such sudden extremities.
Why, wilt thou have me die Spaconia,
What should I doe?
Nay, let me stay alone,
And when you see Armenia again,
You shall behold a Tomb more worth then I,
Some friend that either loves me, or my cause,
Will build me something to distinguish me
From other women: Many a weeping verse
He will lay on, and much lament those maids
That place their loves unfortunately 〈◊〉 hight,
As I have done, where they can never reach:
But why should you go to Iberia?
Alas, that thou wilt ask me; Ask the man
That rages in a fever, why hee lies
Distempered there, when all the other youths
Are coursing ore the Meadows with their loves?
Can I resist it? am I not a slave
To him that conquered me?
That conquered thee, Tigranes he has won but half of
Thy body; but thy mind may be as free
As his, his will did never combat thine,
And take it prisoner:
But if hee by force
Convey my body hence, what helps it me
Or thee to be unwilling?
O Tigranes,
I know you are to see a Lady there,
To see, and like I fear: perhaps the hope
Of her makes you forget me ere we part,
Be happier then you know to wish: farewell.
Spaconia stay, and hear me what I say:
In short destruction meet me, that I may
See it, and not avoid it when I leave
To be thy faithful Lover: part with me
Thou shalt not, there are none that know our love;
And I have given gold to a Captain
That goes unto Iberia from the King,
That he would place a Lady of our Land
With the Kings sister that is offered me;
Thither shall you, and being once got in,
Persuade her by what subtle means you can
To be as backward in her love as I.
Can you imagine that a longing maid
When she beholds you, can be pulled away
With words from loving you?
Dispraise my health,
My honesty, and tell her I am jealous:
Why, I had rather loose you: Can my heart
Consent to let my tongue throw out such words,
And I that ever yet spoke what I thought,
Shall find it such a thing at first to lie:
Yet doe thy best.
What is your Majesty ready?
There is the Lady Captain.
Sweet Lady by your leave, I could wish my self more full of Courtship for your fair sake.
Sir I shall find no want of that.
Lady, you must haste, I have received new letters from the King, that requires more speed then I expected he
will follow me suddenly himself, and begins to call for your Majesty already.
He shall not doe so long.
Sweet Lady shall I call you my charge hereafter?
I will not take upon me to govern your tongue Sir, you shall call me what you please:
MY Lord Bacurius, you must have regard
Unto the Queen, she is your prisoner,
Tic at your peril if she make escape.
My Lord I know it, she is my prisoner
From you committed; yet she is a woman,
And so I keep her safe: you will not urge me
To keep her close, I shall not shame to say
I sorrow for her.
So doe I my Lord.
I sorrow for her that so little grace
Doth govern her, that she should stretch her arm
Against her King, so little womanhood
And natural goodness, as to think the death
Of her own Son.
Thou know the reason why,
Dissembling as thou art, and wilt not speak.
There is a Lady takes not after you,
Her Father is within her, that good man
Whose tears paid down his sins, mark how she weeps,
How well it does become her; and if you
Can find no disposition in your self
To sorrow, yet by gracefulness in her
Find out the way, and by your reason weep:
All this she does for you, and more she needs,
When for your self you will not lose a tear,
Think how this want of grief discredits you,
And you will weep, because you cannot weep:
You talk to me as having got a time
Fit for your purpose; but you know I know
You speak not what you think.
I would my heart
Were stone, before my softness should be urged
Against my Mother, a more troubled thought
No Virgin bears about her; should I excuse
My Mothers fault, I should let light a life,
In loosing which, a brother and a King
Were taken from me; If I seek to save
That life so loved, I loose another life
That gave me being, I shall loose a Mother,
A word of such a sound in a childes ear,
That it strikes reverence through it: May the will
Of Heaven be done, and if one needs must fall,
Take a poor Virgins life to answer all.
But Gobrias let vs talk; you know this fault
Is not in me as in another woman▪
I know it is not:
Yet you make it so.
Why, is not all that's past beyond your help?
I know it is.
Nay, should you publish it
Before the world, think you twill be belieu'd?
I know it would not.
Nay, should I join with you,
Should we not both be torn? and yet both die
Vncredited?
I think we should.
Why then
Take you such violent courses? as for me,
I doe but right in saving of the King
From all your plots.
The King?
I bad you rest with patience, and a time
Would come for me
To reconcile all to your own content:
But by this way you take away my power,
And what was done unknown, was not by me,
But you, your urging, being done,
I must preserve mine own; but time may bring
All this to light, and happily for all.
Accursed be this ouercurious brain,
That gave that plot a birth; accursed this womb,
That after did conceive to my disgrace.
My Lo d Protector, they say there are divers Letters come from Armenia that Bessus has done good service, and brought again a day by his particular valour: received you any to that effect?
Yes, tic most certain.
Ime sorry fort, not that the day was won, but that it was won by him; wee held him here a coward, hee did me wrong once, at which I laughed, and so did all the world: for, nor I, nor any other held time worth my Sword.
Health to my Lord Protector, from the King these Letters, and to your grace Madam these:
How does his Majesty?
As well as conquest by his own means, and his va∣liant commanders can make him▪ your letters will tel you all.
I will not open mine till• doe know
My brothers health; good Captain is he well?
As the rest of vs that fought are:
But howes that, is he hurt?
Hes a strange Soldier that gets not a knock,
I doe not ask how strange that Soldier is That gets no hurt; but whether he have one?
He had divers.
And is he well again?
Well again, ant please your grace; why I was run twice through the body, and shot ith head with a cross are∣row, and yet am well again.
I doe not care how thou dost, is he well?
Not care how I doe, let a man out of the mightiness
of his spirit fructify foreign Countries with his blood for the good of his own, and thus he shall be answered: why, I may live to relieve with spear and shield such a Lady di∣stressed.
Why, I will care, I am glad that thou art well; I prithee is he so?
The King is well, and will be here to morrow.
My prayers are heard; now I will open mine.
Bacurius, I must ease you of your charge:
Madam, the wonted mercy of the King
That overtakes your faults, has met with this,
And struck it out; he has forgiven you freely,
Your own will is your Law, be where you please▪
I thank him
You will be ready
To waite upon his Majesty to morrow?
I will.
Madam, be wise hereafter:
I am glad I have lost this Office.
Good Captain Bessus, tell vs the discourse
Between Tigranes and our King, and how
We got the victory.
I prithee doe,
And if my brother were in any danger,
Let not thy tale make him abide there long,
Before thou bring him off; for all that while
My heart will beat.
Madam, let what will beat, I must tell truth, and thus it was: They fought single in lists but one to one, as for my own part I was dangerously hurt but three days before, else perhaps wee had been two to two; I cannot tell, some thought wee had; and the occasion of my hurt was this, the enemy had made trenches.
Captain, without the manner of your hurt be much material to this business, weal hear it some other time.
I, I prithee leave it, and go on with my brother.
I will, but it would be worth your hearing: To the lists they came, and single sword and gauntlet was their fight.
Alas.
Without the lists there stood some dozen Captains of either side mingled, all which were sworn, and one of those was I: and it was my chance to stand no•e a Captain of the Enemies side, called Tiribasus; valiant they said he was: whilst these two Kings were stretching themselves, this Tire∣basus cast something a scornful look on me, and asked me whom I thought would overcome: I smiled, and told him, if hee would fight with me, he should perceive by the event of that whose King would win; something hee answered, and a scuffle was like to grow, when one Zipetus offered to help him: I—
All this is of thy self, I prithee Bessus
Tell something of my brother, did he nothing?
Why yes, Isle tell your Grace; they were not to fight till the word given, which for my own part by my troth I was not to give.
See, for his own part.
I fear yet this fellowe's abused with a good report.
I, but I:
Still of himself.
Cried, give the word, when as some of them said Ti∣granes was stooping, but the word was not given then: when one Cosro•s of the enemy•s part held up his finger to me, which is as much with vs Marshallists, as I will fight with you: I said not a word, nor made sign during the combat; but that once done.
He slips ore all the fight.
I called him to me, Cosros said I:
I will hear no more.
No, no, Ilie.
I dare be sworn thou dost.
Captain said I, it was so.
I tell thee, I will hear no further.
No, your Grace will wish you had.
I will not wish it: what is this the Lady
My Brother writes to me to take?
An't please your Grace this is she: Charge will
you come nearer the Princes?
You're welcome from your Country, and this Land
Shall show unto you all the kindnesses
That I can make it; what's your name?
Thalestris.
Y are very welcome, you have got a letter
To put you to me, that has power enough
To place mine Enemy here; then much more you,
That are so far from being so to me,
That you ne'er saw me.
Madam, I dare pass my word for her truth.
My truth.
Why Captain, doe you think I am afraid sheele steal?
I cannot tell, servants are slippery; but I dare give my word for her, and for her honesty: she came along with me, and many favours she did me by the way; but by this light none but what she might doe with modesty, to a man of my rank.
Why Captain, here is no body thinks otherwise.
Nay, if you should, your Grace may think your plea∣sure; but I am sure I brought her from Armenia, and in all that way if ever I touched any bare on her aboue her knee, I pray God I may sink where I stand.
Aboue my knee?
No▪ you know I did not, and if any man will say I did, this Sword shall answer: Nay, Isle defend the reputation of my charge whilst I live; your Grace shall understand I am se∣cret in these businesses, and know how to defend a Ladies honour.
I hope your Grace knows him so well already,
I shall not need to tell you hoe's vain and foolish:
I, you may call me what you please, but Isle defend your good name against the World; and so I take my leave of your Grace, and of you my Lord Protector, I am likewise glad to see your Lordship well.
O Captain Bessus, I thank you, I would speak with you anon.
When you please, I will attend your Lordship:
Madam, Isle take my leave too:
Good Bacurius:
Madam, what writes his Majesty to you?
O my Lord,
The kindest words, Isle keep um whilst I live
Here in my bosom; theres no art in um,
They lie disordered in this paper, Just
As hearty Nature speaks um.
And to me
He writes, what tears of joy he shed to hear
How you were grown in every virtuous way,
And yields all thanks to me, for that dear care
Which I was bound to have in training you:
There is no Princes living that enjoys
A Brother of that worth.
My Lord, no Maid longs more for any thing, or feels more heate and cold within her breast, then I doe now, In hope to see him.
Yet I wonder much at this, hee writes he brings a∣long with him a husband for you, that same Captive Prince;
And if he love you as he makes a show,
He will allow you freedom in your choice.
And so he will my Lord, I warrant you
He will but offer, and give me the power
To take▪ or leave.
Trust me, were I a Lady I could not like
That man were bargained with before I choose him.
But I am not built on such wild humours,
If I find time worthy, he is not less,
Because hee▪s offered.
Tic true, he is not, would he would seem less:
I think there is no Lady can affect
Another Prince, your Brother standing by;
He does eclipse men's virtues so with this.
I know a Lady may, and more I fear
Another Lady will.
Would I might see him:
Why so you shall: my businesses are great,
I will attend you when it is his pleasure
To see you Madam.
I thank you good my Lord.
You will be ready Madam:
Yes.
I doe beseech you Madam send away
Your other women, and receive from me
A few sad words, which set against your joys,
May make um shine the more.
Sirs leave me all.
I kneel a stranger here to beg a thing
Unfit for me to ask, and you to grant,
Tic such another strange ill laid request,
As if a beggar should entreat a King
To leave his Sceptre and his Throne to him,
And take his rags to wander ore the World
Hungry and cold.
That were a strange request.
As ill is mine.
Then doe not utter it.
Alas, tic of that nature, that it must
Be vtterd, I, and granted, or I die:
I am ashamed to speak it; but where life
Lies at the stake, I cannot think her woman,
That will not take something unreasonably
To hazard saving of it: I shall seem
A strange petitioner, that wish all ill
To them I beg of, ere they give me ought,
Yet so I must: I would you were not fair,
Nor wise, for in your ill consists my good:
If you were foolish, you would hear my prayer;
If foul, you had not power to hinder me:
He would not love you.
VVhats the meaning of it?
Nay, my request is more without the bounds
Of reason yet; for tic not in the power
Of you to doe what I would have you grant.
Why then tic idle, prithee speak it out.
Your brother brings a Prince into this Land
Of such a noble shape, so sweet a grace,
So full of worth withal, that every maid
That looks upon him, gives away her self
To him for ever; and for you to have
He brings him: and so mad is my demand,
That I desire you not to have this man,
This excellent man, for whom you needs must die,
If you should miss him. I doe now expect
You should laugh at me.
Trust me, I could weep
Rather, for I have found in all thy words
A strange disiointed sorrow.
Tic by me,
His own desire too, that you would not love him.
His own desire, why credit me Thalestris
I am no common wooer: If he shall woo me,
His worth may be such, that I dare not swear
I will not love him; but if he will stay
To have me woo him, I will promise thee
He may keep all his graces to himself,
And fear no ravishing from me.
Tic yet
His own desire, but when he sees your face,
I fear it will not be; therefore I charge you
As you have pity, stop those tender ears
From his enchanting voice, close up those eyes,
That you may neither catch a dart from him,
Nor he from you: I charge you as you hope
To live in quiet, for when I am dead
For certain I shall walk to visit him,
If he break promise with me: for as fast
As oaths without a formal ceremony
Can make me, I am to him:
Then be fearless,
For if he were a thing twixt God and man,
I could gaze on him; (if I knew it sin,
To love him) without passion: Dry your eyes,
I swear you shall enjoy him still for me,
I will not hinder you; but I perceive
You are not what you seem: Rise, rise, Thalestris.
If your right name be so.
Indeed it is not
Spaconia is name; but I desire
Not to be known to others:
Why, by me
You shall not, I will never doe you wrong,
What good I can, I will; think not my birth,
Or education such, that I should injure
A stranger Virgin: you are welcome hither.
In company you wish to be commanded,
But when we are alone, I shall be ready
To be your servant.
Come, come, run, run, run:
We shall out-goe her.
One were better be hanged, then carry women out fid∣ling to these shows.
Is the King hard by?
You heard hee with the bottles say, hee thought wee should come too late, what abundance of people here is.
But what had he in those bottles?
I know not.
Why, Ink good man fool:
Ink, what to doe?
Why, the King look you, will many times call for those bottles, and break his mind to his friends.
Lets take our places quickly, we shall have no room else.
The man told vs hee would walk a foot through the people.
I marry did he.
Our shops are well look to now:
S'life yonders my Master I think.
No, tic not he.
Lord, how fine the fields be, what sweet living tic in the Country.
I, poor souls, God help um; they live as conten∣tedly as one of vs.
My Husbands cousin would have had me gone in∣to the Country last year, were thou ever there?
I, poor souls, I was amongst um once.
And what kind of creatures are they for love of God?
Very good people, God help um:
Wilt thou go with me down this summer, when I am brought abed?
Alas, tic no place for vs.
Why prithee?
Why, you can have nothing there; theres no body cries brooms.
No?
No truly, nor milk.
Nor milk, how doe they?
They are fine to milk themselves ith Country.
Good Lord: but the people there I think will bee very dutiful to one of vs?
I, God knows will they, and yet they doe not great∣lie care for our Husbands.
Doe they not, alas? In good faith I cannot blame them: for we doe not greatly care for them our selves. Philip I pray choose vs a place.
Theres the best forsooth.
By your leave good people a little:
VVhats the matter?
I pray my friend doe not thrust my Mistress so, shees with child.
Let her look to her self then, has she not had thrusting enough yet; if she stay shouldring here, she may hap to go home with a Cake in her belly.
How now goodman squitterbreech, why doe you lean so on me?
Because I will.
Will you sir sawce-box?
Look if one have not struck Philip, come hither Philip, why did he strike thee?
For leaning on him.
Why did thou lean on him?
I did not think he would have struck me.
As God save me law, thou art as wilde as a Buck, there is no quarrel, but thou art at one end or other of it.
Its at the first end then; for he will never stay the last.
Well stripling, I shall meet with you.
when you will.
Isle give a crown to meet with you▪
At a bawdy house.
I, you are full of your rogery; but if I doe meet you it shall cost me a fall.
The King, the King, the King, the King:
Now, now, now, now.
God preserve your Majesty.
I thank you all: Now are my joys at full,
when I behold you safe my loving Subjects;
By you I grow, tic your united love
That lifts me to this height:
All the account that I can render you
For all the love you have bestowed on me,
All your expenses to maintain my war,
Is but a little word: you will imagine
Tic slender payment; yet tic such a word
As is not to be bought without our bloods;
Tic peace.
God preserve your Majesty.
Now you may live securely in your Towns,
Your Children round about you; you may sit
Under your vines, and make the miseries
Of other Kingdoms a discourse for you,
And lend them sorrows: For your selves you may
Safely forget there are such things as tears;
And may you all whose good thoughts I have gained,
Hold me unworthy, when I think my life
A sacrifice too great to keep you thus
In such a calm estate:
God bless your Majesty.
See all good people, I have brought the man,
Whose very name you feared, a captive home:
Behold him, tic Tigranes; in your hearts
Sing songs of gladness, and deliverance.
Out upon him.
How he looks.
Hang him, hang him, hang him.
These are sweet people.
Sir, you doe me wrong,
To render me a scorned spectacle
To common people.
It was far from me
To mean it so: if I have ought deserved,
My loving Subjects let me beg of you
Not to revile this Prince, in whom their dwells
All worth of which the nature of a man
Is capable; valour beyond compare,
The terror of his name has stretched it self
Where ever there is sun: and yet for you,
I fought with him single, and won him too;
I made his valour stoop, and made that name
Soared to so unbelieved a height, to fall
Beneath mine: This inspired with all your loves,
I did perform, and will for your content
Be ever ready for a greater work.
The Lord bless your Majesty.
So, hee has made me amends now, with a speech in commendations of himself: I would not be so vaine-glo∣rios.
If there be any thing in which I may
Doe good to any creature, here speak out;
For I must leave you: and it troubles me,
Thus my occasions for the good of you,
Are suchas ca lles me from you; else my joy
Would be to spend my days amongst you all.
You show your loves in these large multitudes
That come to meet me: I will pray for you,
Heaven prosper you, that you may know old years,
And live to see your Childrens Children
Fate at your boards with plenty: when there is
A want of any thing, let it be known
To me, and I will be a Father to you:
God keep you all.
God bless your Majesty.
Come, shall we go, ell's done.
I for Gods sake, I have not made a fire yet:
Away, away, ell's done.
Content: Farewell Philip.
Away, you haltersack you:
Philip will not fight hoe's afraid on's face.
I marry am I afraid of my face.
Thou would be Philip, if thou saw it in a glass; it looks like a visor.
You'll be hanged sir: Come Philip, walk before vs homeward; did not his Majesty say, he had brought vs home Peaes for our money?
Yes marry did he.
They are the first I heard on this year by my troth, I longed for some of um; did he not say we should have some?
Yes, and so we shall anon I warrant you, have every one a peck brought home to our houses.
MY Sister take it ill?
Not very ill,
Something unkindly she doth take it Sir,
To have her Husband chosen to her hands.
Why Gobrius te• her; I must have her know
My will, and not her own must govern her:
What, will she marry with some slave at home?
O she is far from any stubbornness,
You much mistake her, and no doubt will like
Where you will have her; but when you behold her,
You will be loath to part with such a Jewel.
To part with her, why Gobrius art thou mad? she is my sister▪
Sir, I know she is:
But it were pity to make poor our Land
With such a beauty, to enrich another.
Pish, will she have him?
I think she will Sir.
Were she my Father, and my Mother too;
And all the names for which we think folks friends,
She should be force to have him, when I know
Tic fit: I will not hear her say shoe's loath.
Heaven bring my purpose luckily to pass,
You know tic just: Sir, sheele not need constraint,
She loves you so.
How does she love me, speak?
She loves you more then people love their health
That live by labour; more then I could love
A man that died for me, if he could live again.
She is not like her Mother then?
O no, when you were in Armenia,
I durst not let her know when you were hurt:
For at the first on every little scratch,
She kept her chamber, wept, and would not eat,
Till you were well; and many times the news
was so long coming, that before we heard,
She was as near her death, as you your health.
Alas poor soul, but yet she must be ruled;
J know not how I shall requite her well,
I long to see her; have you sent for her,
To tell her I am ready?
Sir, I have.
Sir, here's the Armenian King.
Hes welcome.
And the Queen Mother, and the Princes waite with∣out:
Good Gobrius bring them in,
Tigranes you will think you are arrived
In a strange Land, where Mothers cast to poison
Their only sons; think you you shall be safe?
Too safe I am 〈◊〉▪
As low as this I bow to you, and would
As low as to my grave, to show a mind
Thankful for all your mercies.
O stand up,
And let me kneel, the light will be ashamed
To see observance done to me by you.
You are my King.
You are my Mother rise;
As far be all your faults from your own soul,
As from my memory; then you shall be
As white as innocence her self.
I came
Only to s•ew my duty, and acknowledge
My sorrow for my sins; longer to stay
We•e but to draw eyes more attentively
upon my shame: That power that kept you safe
From me preserve you still.
Your own desires shall be your guard.
Now let me die,
Since I have seen my Lord the King return
In safety, I have seen all good that life▪
Can show me; I have ne'er another wish▪
For Heaven to grant, nor were it fit I should:
For I am bound to spend my age to come
In give•g than kes that this was granted me.
why does not your Majesty speak?
To whom?
To the Princess.
Alas Sir, I am fearful, you doe look
On me, as if I were some loathed thing
That you were finding out a way to shun.
Sir, you should speak to her.
Ha?
I know I am unworthy, yet not ill,
Armed▪ with which innocence here I will kneel,
Till I am one with earth: but I will gain
Some words, and kindness from you.
will you, speak Sir?
Speak, am I what I was?
what art thou that dost creep into my breast,
And dare not see my face show forth thy self▪
I feel a pair of fiery wings displayed
Hither, from thence; you shall not tarry there,
up, and be gone, if thou be love, be gone,
Or I will tear thee from my wounded flesh,
Pull thy loved down away, and with a quill
By this right arm drawn from thy wanton wing,
write to thy laughing Mother in thy blood,
That you are Powers belied, and all your darts
Are to be blown away by men resolved
Like dust; I know thou fear my words, away.
O misery, why should he be so slow▪
There can no falsehood come of loving her,
Though I have given my faith; she is a thing
Both to be loved and served beyond my faith:
I would he would present me to her quickly.
will you not speak at all, are you so far
From kind words? yet to save my modesty
That must talk till you answer: doe not stand
As you were dumb, say something, though it be
Poisoned with anger that may strike me dead:
Have you no life at all? for manhood sake
Let her not kneel, and talk neglected thus;
A tree would find a tongue to answer her,
Did she but give it such a loved respect.
You mean this Lady, lift her from the earth;
Why doe you let her kneel so long? alas,
Madam your beauty uses to command,
And not to beg; what is your suit to me?
It shall be granted, yet the time is short,
And my affairs are great: but wheres my sister?
I bad she should be brought.
What is he mad?
Gobrius, where is she?
Sir.
Where is she man?
Who Sir?
Who, hast thou forgot? my Sister.
Your Sister Sir?
Your Sister Sir?
Some one that has a wit, answer; where is she?
Doe you not see her there?
Where?
There.
There, where?
S'light there, are you blind?
Which doe you mean, that little one?
No Sir.
No Sir, why doe you mock me? I can see.
No other here, but that petitioning Lady:
Thats she.
Away.
Sir it is she:
Tic false.
Is it?
As hell, by Heaven as false as hell,
My sister: Is she dead? if it be so,
Speak boldly to me: for I am a man,
And dare not quarrel with divinity;
But doe not think to cousin me with this:
I see you all are mute, and stand amazed,
Fearful to answer me; it is too true
A decreed instant cuts off every life,
For which to morn, is to rapine; she died
A Virgin though, more innocent then sleeps,
As clear as her own eyes, and blessedness
Eternal waits upon her where she is:
I know she could not make a wish to change
Her state for new, and you shall see me bear
My crosses like a man; we all must die,
And she hath taught vs how.
Doe not mistake,
And vex your self for nothing; for her death
Is a long life of 〈◊〉 I hope: Tic she,
And if my speech deserve not faith, lay death
Upon me, and my latest words shall force
A credit from you.
Which good Gobrius,
That Lady dost thou mean?
That Lady Sir.
It cannot be.
Pish, this is tedious,
I cannot hold, I must present my self;
And yet the sight of my Spaconia,
Touches me, as a sudden thunderclap
Does one that is about to sin.
Away,
No more of this; here I pronounce him Traitor,
The direct plotter of my death that names,
Or thinks her for my Sister: Tic a lie,
The most malicious of the World, invented
To mad your King; he that will say so next,
Let him draw out his Sword, and sheath it here,
It is a sin fully as pardonable:
She is no kin to me, nor shall she be;
If she were any, I create her none,
And which of you can question this, my power
Is like the Sea, that is to be obeyed,
And not disputed with: I have decreed her
As far from having part of blood with me,
As the naked Indians: Come, and answer me,
He that is boldest now; Is that my Sister?
O this is fine.
No marry is she not an't please your Majesty:
I never thought she was, shees nothing like you.
No, tic true, she is not:
Thou should be hanged.
Sir, I will speak but once: By the same power
You make my blood a stranger unto yours;
You may command me dead, and so much love
A stranger may importune, pray you doe;
If this request appear too much to grant,
Adopt me of some other Family
By your unquestioned word; else I shall live
Like sinful issues that are left in streets
By their regardless Mothers, and no name
Will be found for me.
I will hear no more;
Why should there be such music in a voice,
And sin for me to hear it: All the world
May take delight in this, and tic damnation
For me to doe so; you are fair, and wise,
And virtuous I think, and he is blessed
That is so near you as your brother is:
But you are nought to me but a disease,
Continual torment without hope of ease;
Such an ungodly sickness I have got,
That he that undertakes my cure, must first
Orethrow Divinity, all moral Laws,
And leave mankind as vnconfinde as beasts,
Allowing them to doe all actions
As freely as they drink, when they desire.
Let me not hear you speak again; yet so
I shall but languish for the want of that,
The having which would kill me: No man here
Offer to speak for her; for I consider
As much as you can say: I will not toil
My body, and my mind too, rest thou there,
Here is one within will labour for you both.
I would I were past speaking.
Fear not Madam,
The King will alter, tic some sudden change,
And you shall see it end some other way.
Pray God it doe.
Though she to whom I swore be here, I cannot
Stifle my passion longer: If my Father
Should rise again disquieted with this,
And charge me to forbear, yet it would out:
Madam, a stranger, and a prisoner begs
To be bid welcome.
You are welcome Sir
I think, but if you be not, tic past me
To make you so: for I am here a stranger,
Greater then you: we know from whence you come,
But I appear a lost thing, and by whom
Is yet uncertain; found here in the Court,
And only suffered to walk up and down,
As one not worth the owning.
O, I fear
Tigranes will be caught, he looks me thinks
As he would change his eyes with her; some help
There is aboue for me I hope.
Why doe you turn away, and weep so fast,
And utter things that misbecome your looks,
Can you want owning?
O, tic certain so.
Acknowledge your self mine.
How now?
And then see if you want an owner,
They are talking.
Nations shall own you for their Queen.
Tigranes, art not thou my prisoner?
I am.
And who is this?
She is your Sister.
She is so.
Is she so again, thats well:
And how dare you then offer to change words with her?
Dare doe it, why you brought me hither Sir
To that intent.
Perhaps I told you so,
If I had sworn it, had you so much folly
To credit it: The least word that she speaks
Is worth a life: rule your disordered tongue,
Or I will temper it.
Blessed be that breath.
Temper my tongue; such inciuilities
As these, no barbarous people ever knew:
You break the law of Nature, and of Nations;
You talk to me, as if I were a prisoner
For theft: my tongue be tempered? I must speak
If thunder check me▪ and I will.
You will.
Alas my Fortune.
Doe not fear his frown, dear Madam hear me.
Fear not my frown: but that it were base in me
To fight with one I know I can overcome,
Again thou should be conquered by me.
He has one ransom with him already, me thinks it were good to fight double, or quit.
Away with him to prison; Now Sir see
If my frown be regardless: why delay you?
Seize him Bacurius, you shall know my word
Sweeps like a wind, and all it grapples with▪
Are as the chafe before it.
Touch me not.
Help there.
Away.
It is in vain to struggle.
You must be forced.
Sir, you must pardon vs, we must obey.
Why doe you dally there? Drag him away
By any thing.
Come Sir.
Justice, thou oughtst to give me strength enough
To shake all these off: This is tyrant•ie
Arbaces, subtler then the burning Bulls,
Or that famed Tyrants bed. Thou might as well
Search in the depth of winter through the Snow
For half starved people, to bring home with thee
To show um fire, and send um back again,
As use me thus.
Let him be close Bacurius.
I ne'er rejoiced at any ill to him,
But this imprisonment: what shall become
Of me forsaken?
You will not let your sister
Depart thus discontented from you Sir?
By no means Gobrius, I have done her wrong,
And made my self believe much of my self,
That is not in me: you did kneel to me,
Whilst I stood stubborn and regardless by;
And like a god incensed, gave no ear
To all your prayers: behold, I kneel to you,
Show a contempt as large as was my own,
And I will suffer it; yet at the last forgive me.
O you wrong me more in this,
Then in your rage you did: you mock me now.
Never forgive me then, which is the worst
Can happen to me.
If you be in earnest,
Stand up, and give me but a gentle look,
And two kind words, and I shall be in Heaven.
Rise you then to; here I acknowledge thee
My hope, the only Jewel of my life,
The best of sisters, dearer then my breath,
A happiness as high as I could think;
And when my actions call thee otherwise,
Perdition light upon me.
This is better
Then if you had not frowned, it comes to me
Like mercy at the block; and when I leave
To serve you with my life, your curse be with me.
Then thus I doe salute thee, and again
To make this knot the stronger; Paradise
Is there: It may be you are still in doubt,
This, this third kiss▪ blots it out. I wade in sin,
And foolishly entice my self along:
Take her away, see her a prisoner
In her own chamber▪ closely Gobrius.
Alas Sir, why?
I must not stay the answer, doe it.
Good Sir.
No more, doe it I say.
This is better and better.
Yet hear me speak.
I will not hear you speak;
Away with her, let no man think to speak
For such a creature: for she is a witch,
A poisoner, and a •raytor.
Madam, this Office grieves me.
Nay, tic well the King is pleased with it.
Bessus, go you along too with her; I will prove
All this that I have said, if I may live
So long: but I am desperately sick,
For she has given me poison in a kiss;
She had it twixt her lips, and with her eyes
She witches people: go without a word. 
Why should you that have made me stand in war 
Like fate it self, cutting what threads I pleased,
Decree such an unworthy end of me,
And all my glories? what am I alas,
That you oppose me? If my secret thoughts
Have ever harboured swellings against you,
They could not hurt you, and it is in you
To give me sorrow, that will render me
Apt to re•eiue your mercy; rather so,
Let it be rather so, then punish me
With such unmanly sins: Incest is in me
Dwelling already, and it must be holy
That pulls it thence; where art Mardonius?
Here Sir.
I prithee bear me, if thou can;
Am I not grown a strange weight?
As you were.
No heavier?
No Sir.
Why, my legs
Refuse to bear mybodie; O Mardonius,
Thou hast in field beheld me, when thou know
I could have gone, though I could never run.
And so I shall again.
O no, tic past.
Pray ye go, rest your self.
Wilt thou hereafter when they talk of me,
As thou shalt hear nothing but infamy;
Remember some of those things.
Yes, I will.
I prithee doe: for thou shalt never see me so again.
I warrant ye.
They talk of fame, I have gotten it in the wars, and will afford any man a reasonable penny-worth: some will say they could be content to have it, but that it is to be achieved with danger; but my opinion is otherwise: for if I might stand still in Canon proof, and have fame fall upon me, I would refuse it: My reputation came principally by thinking to run away, which no body knows but Mar∣donius▪ and I think he conceals it to anger me. Before I went to the wars, I came to the Town a young fellow without means, or parts, to this•ue friends; and my empty guts per∣swaded me to lie, and abuse people for my meat, which I did, and they beat me: then would I fast two days, till my hunger cried out on me, rail still; then me thought I had a monstrous stomach to abuse them again, and did it. In this state I continued till they hung me up by th'heeles and beat me with hasle sticks, as if they would have baked me, and have cozened some body with me for Venison: After this I railed, and •ate quietly: for the whole Kingdom took notice of me for a baffel'd whipped fellow, and what I said, was remembered in mirth, but never in anger; of which I was glad,
I would it were at that pass again: After this, God called an Ant of mine, that left two hundred pounds in a Cousins hand for me, who taking me to be a gallant young spirit, raised a company for me with the money, and sent me into Armenia with um: Away I would have run from them, but that I could get no company, and alone I durst not run. I was never at battle but once, and there I was running, but Mardonius cudgeled me; yet I got loose at last, but was so afraid, that I saw no more then my shoulders doe, but fled with my whole company amongst my enemies, and overthrew um: Now the report of my valour is come over before me, and they say I was a raw young fellow, but now I am improu'd. A plague of their eloquence, twill cost me many a beating: And Mar∣donius might help this to if he would; for now they think to get honour of me, and all the men I have abused, call me freshly to account, worthily as they call it, by the way of challenge.
Good morrow Captain Bessus.
Good morrow Sir.
I come to speak with you.
You are very welcome.
From one that holds himself wronged by you some three years since: your worth he says is famed, &amp; he nothing doubts but you will doe him right, as beseems a Soldier.
A pox on um, so they cry all.
And a slight note I have about me for you, for the delivery of which, you must excuse me; it is an office that friendship calls upon me to doe, and no way offensive to you, since I desire but right on both sides.
Tic a challenge Sir, is it not?
Tic an inviting to the field.
An inviting? O cry you mercy, what a complement he delivers it with? he might as agreeablie to my nature pre∣sent me poison with such a speech: um reputation, um call you to an account, um forced to this, um with my sword, um like a gentleman, um dear to me, um satisfaction: Tic very well Sir, I doe accept it, but he must await an answer this thirteen weeks.
Why Sir, he would be glad to wipe off his stain as soon as hee can, Sir upon my credit I am already engaged to two hundred and twelve, all which must have their staines wiped off, if that be the word before him.
Sir, if you be truly engaged but to one, he shall stay a competent time.
Upon my faith Sir to two hundred and twelve, and I have a spent body too much bruised in battle, so that I can∣not fight, I must be plain with you, aboue three combats a day: All the kindness I can doe him, is to set him resolutely in my roll the two hundred and thirteenth man, which is something: for I tell you, I think there will be more after him, then before him, I 〈◊〉 so pray ye commend me to him, and tell him this.
I will Sir, good morrow to you.
Good morrow good Sir. Certainly my safest way were to print my self a coward, with a discovery how I came by my credit, and clap it upon every post: I have recei∣ued aboue thirty challenges within this two hours, marry all but the first • put off with engagement, and by good for∣tune the first is no madder of fighting then I, so that that's re∣feru'd. The place where it must be ended, is four days jour∣ney of, and our arbitrators are there: He has chosen a gen∣tleman in travel, and I have a special friend, with a quar∣terne ague likely to hold him this time here, for mine; and when his man comes home, wee are to expect my friends health: If they would send me challenges thus thick, as long as I lived I would have no other living; I can make seven shillings a day o th paper to the Grocers: yet I learn nothing by all these but a little skill in comparing of stiles. I doe find evidently that there is some one Scrivener in this Town, that has a great hand in writing of challenges, for they are all of a cut, and six of um in a hand; and they all end, my reputation is dear to me, and I must require satisfaction: whose there? more paper I hope; no, tic my Lord Bacurius, I fear all is not well betwixt vs.
Now Captain Bessus, I come about a friuilous mat∣la, cause by as idle a report: you know you were a coward.
Very right.
And wronged me.
True my Lord.
But now people will call you valiant, desertlesly I think yet for their satisfaction, I will have you fight with me.
O my good Lord, my deep engagements.
Tell not me of your engagements, Captain Bessus; it is not to be put off with an excuse: for my own part, I am none of the multitude that believe your conversion from coward.
My Lord, I seek not quarrels, and this belongs not to me, I am not to maintain it.
Who then pray?
Bessus the coward wronged you.
Right.
And shall Bessus the valiant, maintain what Bessus the coward did?
I prithee leave these cheating tricks, I swear thou shalt fight with me, or thou shalt be beat extremely, and kicked.
Since you provoke me thus far my Lord, I will fight with you; and by my Sword it shall cost me twenty pounds, but I will have my leg a week sooner purposely.
Your leg, why what ails your leg? Isle doe a cure on you, stand up.
My Lord, this is not noble in you:
What dost thou with such a phrase in thy mouth?
I will kick thee out of all good words before I leave thee.
My Lord, I take this as a punishment for the offence
I did when I was a coward.
When thou were? confess thy self a coward still, or by this light, Isle beat thee into sponge.
Why I am one:
Are you so Sir, and why doe you wear a sword then? Come, unbuckle, quick.
My Lord.
Unbuckle I say, and give it me, or as I live, thy head will ache extremely.
It is a pretty hilt, and if your Lordship take an affecti∣on to it, with all my heart, I present it to you for a new-yeers gift.
I thank you very heartily, sweet Captain farewell.
One word more, I beseech your Lordship to render me my knife again.
Marry by all means Captain, cherish your self with it, and eat hard good Captain; we cannot tell when∣there we shall have any more such: A due dear Captain.
I will make better use of this, then of my sword: A base spirit has this vantage of a brave one; it keeps always at a stay, nothing brings it down, not beating. I remember I promised the King in a great audience, that I would make my back-byters eat my sword to a knife, how to get another sword I know not, nor know any means left for me to main∣taine my credit but impudence: Therefore will I outsweare him and all his followers, that this is all is left uneaten of my sword.
Isle moan the King, hee is most strangely altered; I guess the cause I fear too right, Heaven has some secret end in it, and tic a securge no question justly laid upon him: Hee has followed me through twenty rooms, and ever when I stay to await his command, he blushes like a girl, and looks upon me, as if modesty kept in his business: so turns away from me, but if I go on, hee follows me again. See, here he is, I doe not use this, yet I know not how, I cannot choose but weep to see him: his very enemies I think, whose wounds have bred his fame, if they should see him now, would find tears in their eyes.
I cannot utter it, why should I keep
A breast to harbour thoughts? I dare not speak:
Darkness is in my bosom, and there lies
A thousand thoughts that cannot brooke the light;
How wilt thou vex me when this deed is done
Conscience? that art afraid to let me name it.
How doe you Sir?
Why very well Mardonius; how dost thou?
Better then you I fear.
I hope thou art; for to be plain• with thee,
Thou art in hell else: secret scorching flame•s
That far transcend earthly material fierce,
Art crept into me, and there is no cure;
Is not that strange Mardonius, theres no cure?
Sir, either I mistake, or there is something hid
That you would utter to me.
So there is, but yet I cannot doe it.
Out with it Sir, i• it be dangerous I shall not shrink to doe you service, I shall no• est•e• • my life a weightier mat∣la then indeed it is, I •n•w tic subi•ct to more chances then it hath thou•es, and I were better loose it in my King• cause, then with an •go. or fall, or sleepin• to a thy••e; as all these are •to•able eno•g•: let me •ut know • ha• I shall do foryou.
It will not out: were you with Gobrius,
And bad him give my sister all content
The place affords, and give her leave to send
And speak to whom she please?
Yes Sir▪ I was.
And did you to Bacurius say as much
About Tigranes?
Yes.
Thats all my business.
O say not so,
You had an answer of all this before,
Besides, I th n•e this business might be vtterd
More carelessly.
Come, thou shalt have it out; I doe beseech thee
By all the love thou hast professed to me,
To see my Sister from me.
Well, and what?
Thats all.
That's strange, shall I say nothing to her?
Not a word;
But if thou love me, find some subtle way
To make her vnsterstand by signs.
But what▪ what s• o•lt I make her understand?
O Mardonius, for that I must be pardoned.
You may, but I can only see her then.
Tic true;
Bear her this ring then, and on more advice
Thou shalt speak to her: Tell her I doe love
My kindred all; wilt thou?
Is there no more?
O yes, and her the best;
Better then any brother loves his sister: That's all.
Me thinks this
Need not have been delivered with such caution;
Isle doe it.
There is more yet,
Wilt thou be faithful to me?
Sir▪ if I take upon me to deliver it,
After I hear it, He pass through fire to doe it▪
I love her better then a brother ought;
Dost thou cons•ue me?
I hope I doe not Sir.
No, thou art dull, kneel down before her▪
And ne'er rise again, till she will love me.
Why, I think she does.
But better then she does, another way;
As wives love Husbands.
Why, I think there are few wives that love their
Husbands better then she does you.
Thou wilt not understand me: is it fit
This should bee vtterd plainl•e; take it then
Naked as it is: I would desire her love
Lasciviously, leudlie, incestuouslie,
To doe a sin that needs must damn vs both;
And thee to▪ Dost thou understand me now?
Yes, there's your Ring again; what have I done
Dishonestly in my whole life, name it▪
That you should put so base a business to me?
Did thou not tell me thou would doe it?
Yes▪ if I undertook it; but if all
My heirs were lives, I would not be engaged
In such a cause •o save my last life.
O guilt, how poor, and weak a thing art thou?
This man that is my servant, whom my breath
Might blow about the world, might beat me here
Having his cause, whilst I pressed down with sin
Could not resist him, dear Mardonius
It was a motion misbeseeming man.
And I am sorry for it.
Pray God you may be so: you must understand, no∣thing that you can utter, can remove my love and service from my Prince. But otherwise, I think I shall not love you more. For you are sinful, and if you doe this crime, you ought to have no laws. For after this it will bee great iniu∣stice in you to punish any offender for any crime: For my self I find my heart too big, I feel I have not patience to look on whilst you run these forbidden courses: Means I have none but your Favour, and I am •ather glad, that I shall loose um both together▪ then keep um with such con∣ditions, I shall find a dwelling amongst some people, where though our garments perhaps be courser, we shall be richer •are within, and harbour no such vices in um. God preserve you, and mend you.
Mardonius, stay Mardonius, For though
My pres•ned state require nothing but knave•s
To be about me, such as are prepared
For every wicked act▪ yet who does know
But that my loathed Fate may turn about,
And I have use of honest men again:
I hope I may, I prethy leave me not.
Where is the King?
There.
An't please your Majesty, ther's the knife.
What knife:
The Sword is eaten.
Away you Fool▪ the King is serious,
And cannot now admit your vanities.
Vanities, I am no honest man if my enemies have not brought it to this, what, doe you think I lie?
No, no, tic well Bessus, tic very well,
I am glad ont'.
If your enemies brought it to that, your enemies are cutlers,
Come, leave the King.
No, let him stay Mardonius, let him stay,
I have occasions with him very weighty,
And I can spare you now.
Sir.
Why I can spare you now.
Mardonius give way to the state affairs
Indeed you are fitter for his present purpose.
Bessus I should employ thee; wilt thou do it
Doe for you, by this ayre I will doe any thing with∣out exception, be it a good, bad, or indifferent thing▪
Do not swear.
By this light but I will,
Any thing whatsoever.
But I shall name a thing
Thy conscience will not suffer thee to doe.
I would fine hear that thing.
Why I would have thee get my Sister for me:
Thou understands me in a wicked manner.
O you would have about with her?
Isle do it, Isle do it In faith.
Wilt thou, dost make no more ant?
More, no, why is there any thing else, if there be tell me, it shall be done.
Hast thou no greater sense of such a sin?
Thou art too wicked for my company
Though I have hell within me, and may yet
Corrupt me further: pray thee answer me
How doe I show to thee after this motion?
Why your Majesty looks as well in my opinion as ever you did since you were borne:
But thou appear to me after thy grant
The ugliest, loathed, detestable thing
That I have ever met with. Thou hast eyes
Like flames of Sulphur, which me thinks doe dart
Infection on me, and thou hast a mouth
Enough to take me in, where there doe stand
Four rows of Iron teeth.
I feel no such thing, but tic no matter how I look, Jle doe your business as well as they that look better, and
when this is dispatcht, if you have a mind to your Mother tell me, and you shall see Isle set it hard:
My Mother, Heaven forgive me to hear this,
I am inspired with horror: I hate thee
Worse then my sin, which if I could come by,
Should suffer death eternal, ne'er to rise
In any breast again. Know I will die
Languishing mad, as I resolve I shall,
Ere I will deal by such an Instrument:
Thou art too sinful to employ in this;
Out of the world, away.
What doe you mean Sir?
Hung round with curses, take thy fearful flight in∣to the deserts, where amongst all the monsters,
If thou findst one foe beastly as thy self,
Thou shalt be held as innocent.
Good Sir.
If there were no such Instruments as thou,
We Kings could never act such wicked deeds:
Seek out a man that mocks Divinity,
That breaks each precept both of Gods and Mans,
And Natures too, and does it without lust;
Me•rely because it is a law, and good,
And live with him: for him thou can not spoil.
Away I say; I will not doe this sin.
Isle press it here till it doe break my breast;
It heaves to get out: but thou art a sin
And spite of torture, I will keep thee in.
Have you written Madam?
Yes, good Gobrias.
And with a kindness, and su•h winning words
As may provoke him at one instant fee e
His double fault, your wrong, and his own rashness.
I have sent words enough, if words may win him
From his displeasure, and such words I hope
As shall gain much upon his goodness, Gobrius:
Yet fearing since they are many, and a women's,
A poor belief may follow; I have woven
As many truths within um to speak for me,
That if he be but gracious, and receive um.
Good Lady, be not fearful; if he should not
Go•e vou your present end in this believe it
You sha l feel (if your virtue can induce you
To labour out this tem•est, which I know
Is but a poor proof •against your patience▪)
All those contents your spirit will arrive at
Newer and sweeter to you; your royal brother
(When he shall once collect himself, and see
How far •e 〈◊〉 been asunder from himself,
What a mere stranger to his golden temper)
M•st from those roots of virtue, (never dying
Though somewhat stopped with humour) shoot again
Into a thousand glories bearing his fa re branches
Hie as our hopes can look at straight as Justice,
Laden with ri e contents: he loves you dearly,
I know it, and I hope I need not further
Win you to understand it.
I believe it,
Howsoever I am sure I love him dearly,
So dearly, that if any thing I write
For my enlarging, should bege• hi anger;
Heaven •e a •itnesse with me, and my faith
I had rather live in•omb'd here.
You shall not feel a vorse stroke then your grief, I am sorr• tic so sharpe: I kiss your hand, and this night will deliver this true story with this hand to your bro∣there.
Peace go with you,
You are a good man; my •paconia
Why are you ever sad thus?
O dear Lady.
〈2 pages missing〉
Many, and strange ones,
I feel my old fire flame again, and burn
So strong and violent, that should I see her
Again, the grief, and that would kill me 〈◊〉.
Your token I acknowledge, you may pass;
There is the King.
I thank your Lordship for it.
She comes, she comes, shame hide me ever from her; would I were buried, or so far removed
Light might not find me out: I dare not see her.
Nay, never hide your self; for were you hid
where earth hides all her riches, ne'er her center;
My wrongs without more day would light me to you:
I must speak ere I die; were all your greatness
Doubled upon you, you're a perjured man,
And only mighty in the wickedness
Of wronging women. Thou art salfe, false Prince,
I live to see it: poor Spaconia lives
To tell thee thou art false; and then no more:
She lives to tell thee thou art more inconstant
Then all ill women ever were together;
Thy faith as firm as raging overflows,
That no bank can command; and as lasting
As boys gay bubbles blown in the air, and broken:
The wind is fixed to thee, and sooner shall
The beaten Mariner with his shrill whistle,
Calm the loud murmurs of the troubled maine,
And strike it smooth again; then thy soul fall
To have peace in love with any: Thou art all
That all good men must hate, and if thy story
Shall tell succeeding ages what thou were,
O let it spare me in it, lest true Lovers
In pity of my wrongs burn thy black legend,
And with their curses shake thy sleeping ashes.
Oh, oh:
The destinies I hope have pointed out
Our ends alike, that thou moist die for love,
Though not for me: for this assure thy self,
The Princess hates thee deadly, and will sooner
Be won to marry with a Bull, and safer,
Then such a beast as thou art: I have struck
I fear too deep; beshrow me fort: Sir,
This sorrow works me like a cunning friendship,
Into the same piece with it; hoe's ashamed,
Alas▪ I have been too rugged: Dear my Lord,
I am sorry I have spoken any thing,
Indeed I am, that may add more restraint
To that too much you have: Good Sir be pleased
To think it was a fault of love, not malice;
And doe as I will doe: forgive it Prince,
I doe, and can forgive the greatest sins
To me you can repent of; pray believe▪me.
O my Spaconia! O thou virtuous woman!
No more, the King Sir.
Have you been careful of our noble Prisoner
That he want nothing fitting for his greatness?
I hope his grace will quit me, for my care Sir.
Tic well, royal Tigranes health.
More then the stricktnesse of this place can give Sir I offer back again to great Arbaces.
We thank you worthy Prince, and pray excuse vs,
We have not seen you since your being here,
I hope your noble usage has been equal
With your own Person: your imprisonment
If it be any, I dare say is eafie,
And shall not outlast two days.
I thank you:
My usage here has been the same it was
Worthy a royal Conqueror. For my restraint
It came unkindly, because much unlooked for;
But I must bear it:
What Lady is that Bacurius?
One of the Princess women Sir.
I feared it: why comes she hither!
To speak with the Prince Tigranes.
From whom Bacurius?
From the Princess Sir.
I know I had seen her.
His fit begins to take him now again
Tic a strange Fever, and twill shake vs all
Anon I fear; would he were well cured of this raging folly: Give me the wars, where men are mad, and may talk what they list, and held the bravest Fellows; This pelting prat∣ling peace is good for nothing: drinking's a virtue to it:
I see theres truth in no man, nor obedience,
But for his own ends, why did you let her in?
It was your own command to bar none from him,
Beside the Princess sent her Ring Sir
For my warrant.
A token to Tigranes, did she not:
Sir tell truth.
I doe not use to lye Sir,
Tic no way I eat or live by, and I think
This is no token Sir.
This combat has undone him: If he had been well beaten, he had been temperate: I shall never see him handsome again, till he have a Horse-mans staff poked through his shoulders, or an arm broke with a Bullet.
I am trifled with.
Sir.
I know it, as I know thee to be false.
Now the clap comes.
You never knew me so Sir, I dare speak it,
And durst a worse man tell me though my better.
Tic well said by my Soul.
Sir you answer as you had no life.
That I fear Sir to loose nobly.
I say Sir once again
You may say Sir what you please.
would I might doe so.
I will Sir, and say openly this woman carries letters, by my life I know she carries letters, this woman does it:
Would Bessus were here to take her aside and search
her, he would quickly tell you what she carried Sir.
I have found it out, this woman carries letters.
If this hold twill be an ill world for Bawds, Cham∣ber-maids, and post-boyes, I thank God I have none but his letters patents, things of his own indicting.
Prince this cunning cannot doe it.
What Sir, I reach you not.
It shall not serve your turn Prince.
Serve my turn Sir.
• Sir it shall not serve your turn.
Be plainer good Sir.
This woman shall carry no more letters back to your love Panthaea, by heaven she shall not, I sa she shall not.
This would make a Saint swear like a Soldier, and a Soldier like termogant.
This beats me more King then the blows you gave me.
Take um away both, and together let um be prison∣ners, strictly and closely kept, or Sir your life shall answer it; and let no body speak with um hereafter.
Well I am subject to you, and must endure these pas∣sions.
This is the imprisonment I have looked for always, and the dear place I would choose.
Sir, have you done well now?
Dare you reprove it?
No.
You must be crossing me.
I have no letters Sir to anger you,
But a dry sonnet of my Corporals
To an old Sadlers wife, and that Isle burn Sir:
Tic like to prove a fine age for the Ignorant.
How dare thou so often forfeit thy life,
Thou know tic in my power to take it.
Yes, and I know you wonnot, or if you doe, you'll miss it quickly.
Why?
Who shall then tell you of these childish follies
When I am dead? Who shall put to his power
To draw those virtues out of a flood of humours
Where they are drowned, and make um shine again?
No cut my head off: doe, kill me:
Then you may talk, and be beleeud, and grow,
And have your too selfe-glorious temper rot••
Into a dead sleep, and the kingdom with you,
Like foreign swords be in your throats, and slaughter
Be every where about you like your flatterers.
Doe, kill me.
Prithee be tamer good Mardonius,
Thou know I love thee, nay I honour thee:
Believe it good old Soldier I am all thine:
But I am racked clean from my self, bear with me,
Wooed thou bear with me good Mardonius.
There comes a good man, love him too, hes tempe∣rate,
You may live to have need of such a virtue,
Rage is not still in fashion.
Welcome good Gobrius.
My service, and this letter to your grace.
From whom?
From the rich mine of virtue, and all beauty,
Your mournful Sister.
She is in prison Gobrius, is she not?
She is Sir till your pleasure doe enlarge her,
Which on my knees I beg; O tic not fit
That all the sweetness of the world in one;
The youth, and virtue, that would have wilde Tigers
And wilder people, that have known no manners
Should live thus Cloysterd up, For your loves sake
(If there be any in that Noble heart)
To her a wretched Lady, and forlorn,
Or for her love to you, (which is as much
As Nature, and obedience ever gave)
Have pity on her beauties.
Prithee stand up, tic true she is too Fair,
And all these commendations but her own:
Would thou had never so commended her,
Or I ne'er lived to have heard it, Gobrius;
If thou but knew of the wrong her beauty does her,
Thou would in pity of her be a liar:
Thy ignorance has drawn me wretched man
Whether my self nor thou can well tell, O my Fate,
I think she loves me; but I fear another
Is deeper in her heart: how think thou Gobrius?
I doe beseech your Grace believe it not,
For let me perish if it be not false:
Good Sir read her letter.
This love, or what a devil is it, I know not, be∣gets more mischief then a wake. I had rather be we I beaten starved, or lousy, then live within the air ont. He that had seen this brave fellow charge through a grove of pikes but tother day, and look upon him now, will ne'er believe his eyes again; If he continue thus but two days more, a Taylor may beat him with one hand tied behind him.
Alas she would be at liberty,
And there be thousand reasons Gobrius
That will deny it:
Which if she knew, she would contentedly
Be where she is and bless her virtue for it,
And me though she were closer, She would Gobrius,
Good man indeed she would.
Then good Sir for her satisfaction
Send for her, and with reason make her know
Why she must live thus from you.
I will go bring her to me.
Y' are very welcome both, some stools there boy,
And reach a Table; Gentlemen of the Sword,
Pray sit without more complement: be gone child,
I have been curious in the searching of you,
Because I understood you wise, and valiant persons.
we understand our selves Sir.
Nay Gentlemen, and my dear friends of the Sword,
No complement I pray; but to the cause
I hang upon, which in few, is my honour.
You cannot hang too much Sir for your honour,
But to your cause, be wise, and speak truth.
My first doubt is my beating by my Prince.
Stay there a little Sir, doe you doubt a beating,
Or have you had a beating by your Prince.
Gentlemen ath'sword, my Prince has beaten me.
Brother what think you of this case
If he have beaten him, the case is clear.
If he have beaten him I grant the case;
But how? We cannot be too subtle in this business
I say, but how?
Even with his royal hand.
Was it a blow of love or indignation.
T was twenty blows of indignation gentlemen,
Besides two blows ath'face.
Those blows ath'face have made a new case ont',
The rest were but an honourable rud•ness▪
Two blows oth'face, and given by a worse man, I must confess as we Sword-men say, had turned the business: Mark me brother, by a worse man; but being by his Prince, had they been ten, and those ten drawn ten teeth, beside the hazard of his nose for ever; all these had been but favours: This is my flat opinion, which Isle die in.
The King may doe much Captain beieeue it, for had hee cracked your skull through like a bottle, or broke a rib or two with crossing of you, yet you had lost no honour: This is strange you may imagine; but this is truth now Captain.
I will be glad to embrace it gentleman;
But how far may he strike me?
Theres another,
A new cause rising from the time, and distance,
In which I will deliver my opinion:
He may strike, beat, or cause to be beaten; for these are natu∣rall to man: your Prince I say may beat you so far forth as his dominion reaches; that's for the distance, the time, ten mile a day▪ I take it.
Brother you err, tic fifteen mile a day,
His stage is ten, his beatings are fifteen.
Tic a the longest, but we subjects must
Be subject to it: you are wise, and virtuous.
Obedience ever makes that noble use ont,
To which I dedicate my beaten body;
I must trouble you a little further Gentlemen of the Sword.
No trouble at all to vs Sir, if we may
Profit your understanding; we are bound
By virtue of ou• calling, to utter our opinions
Shortly, and dis•reetly.
My sorest business is, I have been kicked.
How far Sir?
Not to slatter my self in it all over, my sword forced, but not lost; for dis•reetely I rendered it to save that impu∣tation.
It showed discretion the best part of valour.
Brother, this is a pretty case, pray ponder on it,
Our friend here has been kicked.
He has so brother.
Sorely he says: Now had he sit down here
Upon the mere kick, it had been cowardly.
I think it had been cowardly indeed.
But our friend has r•d••med it, in delivering
His sword without compulsion; and that man
That took it of him, I pronounce a weak one,
And his kicks nullities.
He should have kicked him after the delivery,
Which is the confirmation of a coward.
Brother, I take it you mistake the question:
For say that I were kicked.
I must not say so;
Nor I must not hear it spoke byth' tongue of man
You kicked dear brother; you are merry.
But put the case I were kicked?
Lot them put it that are things weary of their lives, &amp; know not honour: put case you were kicked?
I doe not say I was kicked.
Nor no silly creature, that wears his head without a case, his soul in a skin-coate: you kicked dear brother.
Nay Gentlemen, let vs doe what we shall doe
Truly and honestly; good Sit to the question.
Why then I say, suppose your boy kicked Captain?
The boy may be supposed, hoe's liable; but kick my brother?
A foolish forward zeal Sir in my friend;
But to the boy, suppose the boy were kicked?
I doe suppose it.
Has your boy a sword?
Surely no: I pray suppose a sword too.
I doe suppose it: you grant your boy was kicked then.
By no means Captain, let it be supposed still; this word grant, makes not for vs.
I say this must be granted.
This must be granted brother?
I, this must be granted.
Still the must:
I say this must be granted.
Give me the must again, ag•in; brother you palter.
I will not hear you wasp.
Brother, I say you palter, the must three times toge∣there; I wear as sharpe steel as another man,
And my Fox bites as deep, must•• my dear brother:
But to the cause again:
Nay, look you Gentlemen.
In a word I ha done.
A tall man, but intemperate; tic great pity:
Once more suppose the boy kicked.
Forward.
And being thoroughly kicked, laughs at the kicker▪
So much for vs; proceed.
And in this beaten scorn, as I may call it,
Delivers up his weapon: where lies the error?
It lies ith beating Sir,
I found it four days since.
The error, and a sore one, as I take it;
Lies in the thing kicking.
I understand that well, tic sore indeed Sir.
That is according to the man that did it.
There springs a new branch: whose was the foo•e?
Ah Lords.
The cause is mighty, but had it been two Lords,
And both had kicked you, if you laughed, tic clear.
I did laugh,
But how will that help me Gentlemen?
Yes, it shall help you, if you laughed aloud.
As loud as a kicked man could laugh, I laughed Sir:
My reason now; the valiant man is known
By suffering and contemning, you have
Enough of both, and you are valiant.
If he be sure he has been kicked enough:
For that brave sufferance you speak of brother,
Consists not in a beating, and away,
But in a cudgeld body, from eighteen
To eight and thirty: in a head rebuk't
With pots of all Size, daggers, stools, and bedstaues,
This shows a valiant man.
Then I am valiant, as valiant, as the proudest,
For these are all familiar things to me:
Familiar as my sleep, or want of money.
All my whole bodi's but one bruise with beating,
I think I have been cudgeld with all nations,
And almost all Religions.
Embrace him brother, this man is valiant,
I know it by my self hes valiant.
Captain thou art a valiant Gentleman
To abide upon it, a very valiant man.
My equal friends ath'sword, I must request your hands to this.
Tic fit it should be.
Boy get some wine, and pen and ink within:
Am I clear Gentlemen?
Sir when the world has taken notice what we have done,
Make much of your body, for Isle pawn my steel,
Men will be coyer of their legs hereafter.
I must request you go along, and testify to the Lord Bacurius, whose foot has struck me, how you find my cause.
We will, and tell that Lord he must be ruled,
Or there be those abroad will rule his Lordship.
Sir her's the Princess.
Leave vs then alone.
For the maine cause of her imprisonment
Must not be heard by any but her self:
You are welcome Sister, and I would to God
I could so bid you by another name,
If you aboue love not such sins as these▪
Circle my heart with thoughts as cold as snow
To quench these rising flames that harbour here.
Sir, does it please you, I should speak.
Please me,
I more then all the art of Music can;
Thy speech does please me, for it ever sounds
As thou broughts joyful unexpected news:
And yet it is not fit thou should•t be heard,
I prithee think so.
Be it so, I will.
I am the first that ever had a wrong
So far from being fit to have redress,
That it was unfit to hear it; I will back
To prison rather, then disquiet you,
And waite till it be fit.
No, doe not go,
For I will hear thee with a serious thought:
I have collected all thats man about me
Together strongly, and I am resolved
To hear the• largely, but I doe beseech thee
Doe not come nearer to me, for there is
Something in that that will undo• vs both.
Alas Sir, am I venom?
Yes to me.
Though of thy self I think thee to be in
As equal a degree of heate, •r cold
As Nature can make, yet as ••sound men
Convert the sweetest, and the nourishingst meates
Into diseases, so shall I distempered,
Doe thee, I prethe• draw no •eerer to me.
Sir this is that I would, I am of late,
Shut from the world, and why it should be thus
Is all I wish to know.
Why credit me
Panthaea, credit me that am thy brother,
Thy loving brother, that there is a cause
Sufficient, vet unfit for thee to know,
That might undo thee eu•rlastingly
Only to hear•, wilt thou b•• credit this;
By heaven •is true, b•leeu• it if thou can•t.
Children a•• •oo••s are e•e• credulous;
And I am both I thy•ke, for I b•l•eve:
If you dissemble be it on your head,
Isle back unto my•rison▪ yet me thinks
I might be kept in some place where you are:
For in my self • find, I know not what
To call it, but it is a great desire
To see you often.
Fie, you come in a step, what doc you mean
Dear Sister▪ doe not so: Alas Pa•thaea,
Where I am, would you be, why thats the cause
You are imprisoned, that you may not be
Where I am.
Then I must endure it Sir, God keep you.
Nay, you shall hear the cause in short Panthaea;
And when thou hearst it, thou wilt blush for me,
And hang thy head down like a Violet
Full of the mornings dew: There is a way
To gain thy freedom, but tic such a one
As puts thee in worse bondage, and I know,
Thou would encounter fire, and make a proof
Whether the Gods have care of innocents,
Rather then follow it; know I have lo•t
The only difference betwixt man, and beast,
My reason.
Heaven forbid.
Nay it is gone,
And I am left as far without a bound,
As the wild Ocean that obeys the winds;
Each suddai•e pass•on throws me as it lifts,
And ouerwhelmes all that oppose my will:
I have beheld thee with a lustful eye:
My heart is set on wickedness, to act
Such sins with thee, as I have been afraid
To think off: If thou dare consent to this,
(Which I beseech thee doe not) thou moist gain
Thy liberty, and yield me a content:
If not thy dwelling must be dark, and close
Where I may never see thee; For God knows
That laid this punishment upon my pride,
Thy sight at some time will enforce my madness
To make a start eye to thy ravishing:
Now spit upon me, and call all reproaches
Thou can devise together; and at once
Hurl um against me: for I am a sickness
As killing as the plague, ready to seize thee.
Far be it from me to r•uile the King:
But it is true, that I should rather choose
To search out death, that else would search out me,
And in a grave sleep with my innocence,
Then welcome such a sin: It is my fate,
To these cross accidents I was ordained,
And must have patience; and but that my eyes
Have more of woman in um then my heart,
I would not weep: peace enter you again.
Farewell, and good Panthaea pray for me;
Thy prayers are pure, that I may find a death,
How ever soon before my passions grow,
That they forget, what I desire, is sin;
For thither they are tending: If that happen,
Then I shall force thee, though thou were a Virgin
By vow to Heaven, and shall pull a heap
Of strange▪ yet vninuented sins upon me.
Sir, I will pray for you▪ yet you shall know
It is a sullen •ate that governs vs.
For I could wish as heartily as you
I were no sister to you▪ I should then
Embrace your lawful love sooner then health.
Could •thou affect me then?
So perfectly
That as it is, I ne'er shall sway my heart
To like another.
Then I curse my birth,
Must this be added to my miseries
That thou art willing too, Is there no steppe
To our full happen•se, but these mere sounds
Brother and Sister.
There is nothing else
But these alas will separate vs more
Then twenty worlds betwixt vs.
I have lived
To conquer men, and now am overthrown
Only by words, Brother and Sister: where
Have those words dwelling? I will find um out
And utterly destroy them, but they are
Not to be grasp't▪ let um be men or beasts,
And I will cut um from the earth, or towns,
And I will rase um, and then blow um up:
Let um be Seas, and I will drink them off,
And yet have unquenched fire left in my breast:
Let um be any thing but merely voice▪
But tic not in the power of any Force
Or policy to conquer them.
Panthaea,
What shall wee doe? shall we stand firmly here, and gaze our eyes out?
Would I could doe so;
But I shall weep out mine.
Accursed man,
Thou boughtst thy reason at too dear a rate;
For thou haft all thy actions bounded in
With curious rules, when cuerie Beast is free:
What is there that acknowledges a kindred
But wretched Man? Who ever saw the Bull
Fearfully leave the Heifer that he liked,
Because they had one Dam?
Sir, I disturb you,
And my self too; it were better I were gone:
I will not be so foolish as I was.
Stay, we will love just as becomes our births,
No otherwise: Brothers and Sisters may
VValke hand in hand together; so will we
Come nearer: Is there any hurt in this?
I hope not.
Faith theres none at all:
And tell me truly now, is there not one
You love aboue me?
No by Heaven.
Yet you sent unto Tigranes Sister.
True, but for another: for the truth—
No more,
Isle credit thee; I know thou can not lie,
Thou art all truth.
But is there nothing else
That we may doe, but only walk; me thinks
Brothers and sisters lawfully may kiss.
And so they may Panthaea, so will we,
And kiss again too; we were scrupulous
And foolish, but we will be so no more.
If you have any mercy, let me go
To prison, to my death, to any thing:
I feel a sin growing upon my blood,
Worse then all these, hotter I fear then yours.
That is impossible, what should we doe?
Fly •it for Gods sake.
So we must, away;
Sin grows upon vs more by this delay.
SIR, the King has seen your Commission, and •eleeu•s it, and freely by this warrant gives you leave to visit Prince Tigranes your noble Master.
I thank his Grace, and kiss his hanes.
But is the maine of all your business Ended in this?
I have another, but a worse; I am ashamed, it is a business.—
You serve a worthy person, and a stranger I am sure you are; you may employ me if you please, without your purse, such Office should ever be their own rewards.
I am bound to your nobleness.
I may have need of you, and then this courtesy,
If it be any, is not ill bestowed:
But may I civilly desire the rest?
I shall not be a hurter, if no helper.
Sir, you shall know I have lost a foolish daughter,
And with her all my patience; pilferd away,
By a mean Captain of your Kings.
Stay there Sir:
If he have reached the noble worth of Captain,
He may well claim a worthy gentlewoman,
Though she were yours, and noble.
I grant all that too: but this wretched fellow
Reaches no further then the empty name,
That serves to feed him; were he valiant,
Or had but in him any noble nature,
That might hereafter promise him a good man;
My carcs were something lighter, and my grave
A span yet from me.
I confess such fellows
Be in all royal Camps, and have, and must be
To make the 〈◊〉 of coward more detested
In the mean Soldier, that with such a foil
Sets of much valour: By description
I should now guess him to you. It was Bessus,
I dare almost with confidence pronounce it.
Tic such a scurvy name as Bessus, and now I think tic hee.
Captain, doe you call him?
Believe me Sir, you have a misery
Too mighty for your age: A pox upon him,
〈2 pages missing〉
You a valiant fellow for all this.
My daughter is a Whore,
I feel it now too sensible; yet I will see her,
Discharge my self of being Father to her,
And then back to my Country, and there die;
Farewell Captain.
Farewell Sir, farewell, commend me to the Gentle∣woman I pr•in.
How now Captain, bear up man.
Gentlemen ath'sword your hands once more, I have Been kicked again, but the foolish fellow is penitent,
Has asked me mercy, and my honor's safe.
We knew that, or the foolish fellow had better a kick't His Grandsire.
Confirm, confirm I pray.
There be our hands again.
Now let him come, and say he was not sorry,
And he sleeps for it.
Alas good ignorant old man, let him go,
Let him go, these courses will undo him.
My Lord your authority is good, and I am glad it is so, for my confined would never hinder you from seeing your own King. I am a Minister, but not a governor of this state; yonder is your King, Isle leave you.
There he is indeed,
And with him my disloyal child.
I doe perceive my fault so much, that yet
Me thinks thou should not have forgiven me.
Health to your Majesty.
What? good Ligones, welcome; what business brought thee hither?
Several Businesses.
My public business will appear by this:
I have a message to deliver, which
If it please you so to authorise, is
An embassage from the Armenian state;
Unto Arbaces for your liberty▪
The offer's there set down, please you to read it.
There is no alteration happened
Since I came thence?
None Sir, all is as it was.
And all our friends are well.
All very well.
Though I have done nothing but what was good,
I dare not see my Father: It was fault
Enough not to acquaint him with that good.
Madam I should have seen you.
O good Sir forgive me.
Forgive you, why I am no kin to you, am I?
Should it be measured by my mean deserts,
Indeed you are not.
Thou could prate unhappily
Ere thou could go, would thou could doe as well.
And how does your custom hold out here.
Sir.
Are you in private still, or how?
What doe you mean?
Doe you take money? are you come to sell sin yet? perhaps I can help you to liberal Clients: or has not the King cast you off yet? O thou wild creature, whose best com∣mendation is, that thou art a young VVhore. I would thy Mother had lived to see this: or rather would I had dyed ere I had seen it: why did not make me acquainted when thou were first resolved to be a Who•e? I would have seen thy hot lust satisfied more privately. I would have kept a dancer, and a whole consort of Musicians in mine own house, only to fiddle thee.
Sir I was never whore.
If thou could not say so much for thy self thou should be Carted.
Ligones I have read it, and like it,
You shall deliver it.
Well Sir I will: but I have private business with you.
Speak, what first?
How has my age deserved so ill of you,
That you can pick no strumpets in the Land,
But out of my breed.
Strumpets good Ligones?
Yes, and I wish to have you know, I scorn
To get a Whore for any Prince alive,
And yet scorn will not help me thinks: My daughter
Might have been spared, there were enough beside.
May I not prosper, but Shoe's innocent
As morning light for me, and I dare swear
For all the world.
Why is she with you then?
Can she waite on you better then your men,
Has she a gift in plucking off your stockings,
Can she make Cawdles well, or cut your Corns,
Why doe you keep her with you? For your Queen
I know you doe contemn her, so should I
And every Subject else think much at it.
• et um think much, but tic more firm then earth
Thou see thy Queen there.
Then have I made a fair hand, I called her Whore,
If I shall speak now as her Father, I cannot of use
But greatly rejoice that she shall be a Queen: but if
I should speak to you as a Statesman she were more fit
To be your VVhore.
Get you about your business to Arbaces,
Now you talk idly.
Yes Sir, I will go.
And shall she be a Queeue, she had more wit
Then her old Father when she ran away:
Shall she be a Queen, now by my troth tic fine,
He dance out of all measure at her wedding:
Shall I not Sir?
Yes marry shalt thou.
In make these witherd Kexes bear my body
Two h••rest gether aboue ground.
Nay, go▪ my business requires haste.
Good God preserve you, you are an excellent King.
Farewell good Father.
Farewell sweet virtuous Daughter;
Ineuer was so Joyful in my life,
That I remember: shall she be a Queen?
Now I perceive a man may weep for joy,
I had thought they had lied that said so.
Come my dear love.
But you may see another
May alter that again.
Urge it no more;
I have made up a new strong constancy,
Not to be shook with eyes; I know I have
The passions of a man, but if I meet
With any subject that shall hold my eyes
More firmly then is fit; Isle think of thee,
And run away from it: let that suffice.
Three gentlemen without to speak with me?
Yes Sir. Bac. Let them come in.
They are entered Sir already.
Now fellows, your business, are these the Gentlemen.
My Lord I have made bold to bring these Gentlemen my Friends ath'sword along with me.
I am afraid you'll fight then.
My good Lord I will not, your Lordship is mistaken,
Fear not Lord.
Sir I am sorry fort.
I can ask no more in honour, Gentlemen you hear my Lord is sorry:
Not that I have beaten you, but beaten one that will be beaten: one whose dull body will require lancing: As surfeits doe the diet, spring and full. Stock-fish? Now to your swordmen, what come they for good Captain
It seems your Lordship has forgot my name.
No nor your nature neither, though they are things fitter I confess for any thing, then my remembrance, or any honest mans, what shall these billets doe, be piled up in my VVood-yard?
Your Lordship holds your mirth still, God continue it: but for these Gentlemen they come.
To swear you are a Coward, spare your Book, I doe believe it.
Your Lordship still draws wide, they come to vouch under their valiant hands, I am no Coward.
That would be a show indeed worth seeing: sir be wise and take money for this motion, travel with it, and where the name of Bessus has been known, or a good Cow∣art stirring, twill yield more then a tilting. This will prove more beneficial to you, if you be thrifty, then your Captaineship, and more natural; Men of most valiant hands is this true?
It is so most renowned,
Tic somewhat strange.
Lord, it is strange, yet true; wee have examined from your Lordships foot there to this mans head, the nature of the beatings; and we doe find his honour is come off clean, and sufficient: This as our swords shall help vs.
You are much bound to your bilbow-men, I am glad you are straight again Captain▪ it were good you would think some way to gratify them, they have undergone a la∣bore for you Bessus, would have puzzeld Hercules, with all his valour.
Your Lordship must understand we are no men ath' Law, that take pay for our opinions: it is sufficient wee have cleared our friend.
Yet here is something due, which I as touched in con∣science will discharge Captain; Isle pay this rent for you.
Spare your self my good Lord; my brave friends aim at nothing but the virtue.
Thats but a cold discharge Sir for their pains.
O Lord▪ my good Lord.
Be not so modest, I will give you something.
They shall dine with your Lordship, that's sufficient.
Something in hand the while; ye rogues, ye apple∣squires: doe you come hither with your bottled valour, your windle froth, to limit out my beatings.
I doe beseech your Lordship.
O good Lord.
Sfoote, what a many of beaten slaves are here? get me a cudgel sir, and a tough one.
More of your foot, I doe beseech your Lordship.
You shall, you shall dog, and your fellow beagle.
A this side good my Lord.
Off with your swords, for if you hurt my foot, Isle have you fleade you rascals.
Mines off my Lord.
I beseech your Lordship stay a little, my strap's tied to my codpiece point: Now when you please.
Captain, these are your valiant friends, you long for a little too?
I am very well, I humbly thank your Lordship.
Whats that in your pocket slave, my key you mung∣rell? thy buttocks cannot be so hard, out with it quickly.
Here tic Sir, a small piece of Artillery, that a gentle∣man a dear friend of your Lordships sent me with to get it mended Sir; for if you mark, the nose is somewhat loose.
A friend of mine you rascal, I was never wearier of doing nothing, then kicking these two foote-bals.
Here is a good cudgel Sir.
It comes too late; I am weary, prithee doe thou beat um.
My Lord this is foul play in faith, to put a fresh man v∣pone vs; Men are but men.
That i••t shall save your bones, up with your rotten regiment, and be gone; I had rather thresh, then be bound to kick these raskals, till they cried hold: Bessus you may put your hand to them now, and then you are quit. Farewell, as you like this, pray visit me again, twill keep me in good breath.
Has a devilish hard foot, I never felt the like.
Nor I, and yet Ime sure I ha felt a hundred.
If he kick thus ith dog-daies, he will be dry founderd: what cure now Captain, besides oil of baize?
Why well enough I warrant you, you can go.
Yes, God be thanked; but I feel a shrewd ach, sure he has sprang my huckle bone.
I ha loft a haunch.
A little butter friend, a little butter▪ butter and parse∣lie is a sovereign matter: probatum est.
Captain, we must request your hands now to our ho∣nurse.
Yes marry shall ye, and then let all the world come, we are valiant to our selves, and theres an end:
Nay, then we must be valiant; O my ribs.
O my small guts, a plague upon these sharpe toe'd shoes, they are murderers.
It is resolved, I bore it whilst I could,
I can no more, Hell open all thy gates,
And I will thorough them; if they be shut,
Isle batter um, but I will find the place
Where the most damned have dwelling; ere I end,
Amongst them all they shall not have a sin,
But I may call it mine: I must begin
With murder of my friend, and so go on
To an incestuous ravishing, and end
My life and sins with a forbidden blow
Upon my self.
What Tragedy is ne'er?
That hand was never wont to draw a Sword,
But it cried dead to something:
have you bid Gobrius come?
How doe you Sir?
well, is he coming?
why Sir are you thus?
why does your hand proclaim a lawless war
Against your self?
Thou answer me one question with another,
Is Gobrius coming?
Sir he is.
Tic well.
I can forbear your questions then, be gone Sir, I have marked.
Mark less, it troubles you and me.
You are more variable then you were.
It may be so.
To day no Hermit could be humblier
Then you were to vs all.
And what of this?
And now you take new rage into your eyes,
As you would look vs all out of the Land.
I doe confess it, will that satisfy,
I prithee get thee gone.
Sir I will speak.
Will ye?
It is my duty,
I fear you will kill your self: I am a subject,
And you shall doe me wrong in it: tic my cause,
And I may speak.
Thou art not trained in sin,
It seems Mardonius: kill my self, by heaven
I will not doe it yet; and when I will,
Isle tell thee then: I shall be such a creature,
That thou wilt give me leave without a word.
There is a method in mans wickedness,
It grows up by degrees; I am not come
So high as killing of my self, there are
A hundred thousand sins twixt me and it,
Which I must doe, I shall come toot at last;
But take my oath not now, be satisfied,
And get thee hence.
I am sorry tic so ill.
Be sorry then,
True sorrow is alone, grieve by thy self.
I pray you let me see your sword put up
Before I go; Isle leave you then.
Why so?
What folly is this in thee? is it not
As apt to mischief as it was before?
Can I not reach it think thou? these are toys
For children to be pleased with, and not men;
Now I am safe you think: I would the book
Of Fate were here, my sword is not so sure,
But I should get it out, and mangle that
That all the destinies should quite forget
Their fixed decrees, and hast to make vs new
Far other Fortunes, mine could not be worse,
Wilt thou now leave me?
God put into your bosom temperate thoughts,
Isle leave you though I fear.
Go, thou art honest,
Why should the hasty errors of my youth
Be so unpardonable, to draw a sin
Helpless upon me?
There is the King, now it is ripe.
Draw near thou guilty man,
That art the author of the loathedst crime
Five ages have brought forth, and hear me speak
Curses incurable, and all the evils
Mans b•die or his spirit can receive
Be with thee.
Why Sir doe you curse me thus?
Why doe I curse thee, if there be a man
Subtle in curses, that exceeds the rest,
His worst wish on thee. Thou hast broke my hart.
How Sir? Have I preserved you from a child,
From all the arrows, malice or ambition
Could shoot at you, and have I this for pay?
Tic true thou did preserve me, and in that
VVert crueiler then hardened murderers
Of Infants and their mothers; thou did save me
Only till thou had studied out a way
How to destroy me cunningly thy self:
This was a curious way of torturing.
What doe you mean?
Thou know the evils thou hast done to me,
Dost thou remember all those witching letters
Thou sentst unto me to Armenia,
Filled with the praise of my beloved Sister,
Where thou extolst her beauty; what had I
To doe with that, what could her beauty be
To me, and thou did write how well she loved me,
Doest thou remember this: so that I doted
Something before I saw her.
This is true.
Is it, and • when I was returned thou know
Thou did pursue it, till thou woundst me into
Such a strange, and unbelieved affection,
As good men cannot think on.
This I grant, I think I was the cause.
VVert thou▪ Nay more, I think thou meantst it.
Sir I have a lie
As I love God and honesty, I did:
It was my meaning.
Be thine own sad Judge,
A further condemnation will not need:
Prepare thy self to die.
Why Sir to die?
Why would thou live, was ever yet offender
So impudent, that had a thought of mercy
After confession of a crime like this?
Get out I cannot, where thou hurlst me in,
But I can take revenge, that's all the sweetness
Left for me.
Now is the time, hear me but speak.
No, yet I will be far more merciful
Then thou were to me; thou did steal into me,
And never gave me warning: so much time
As I give thee now, had prevented thee
For ever. Notwithstanding all thy sins,
If thou hast hope, that there is yet a prayer
To save thee, turn, and speak it to your self.
Sir, you shall know your sins before you doe um If you kill me.
I will not stay then.
Know you kill your Father.
How?
You kill your Father.
My Father? though I know it for a lie
Made out of fear to save thy stained life:
The very reverence of the word comes cross me,
And ties mine arm down.
I will tell you that shall heighten you again, I am thy
Father, I charge thee hear me.
If it should be so,
As tic most false, and that I should be sound
A bastard issue, the despised fruit
Of lawless lust, I should no more admire
All my wilde passions: but another truth
Shall be wrung from thee: If I could come by
The spirit of pain, it should be powered on thee,
Till thou allowest thy self more full of lies
Then he that teaches thee.
Turn thee about,
I come to speak to thee thou wicked man,
Hear me thou Tyrant.
I will turn to thee,
Hear me thou Strumpet: I have blotted out
The name of mother, as thou hast thy shame.
My shame, thou hast less shame then any thing:
Why dost thou keep my daughter in a prison?
Why dost thou call her Sister, and doe this?
Cease thou strange impudence, and answer quickly,
If thou contemn'st me, this will ask an answer,
And have it.
Help me gentle Gobrius.
Guilt dare not help guilt, though they grow together
In doing ill, yet at the punishment
They sever, and each flies the noise of other,
Think not of help, answer.
I will, to what?
To such a thing as if it be a truth,
Think what a creature thou hast made thy self,
That did not shame to doe, what I must blush
Only to ask thee: tell me who I am,
Whose son I am, without all circumstance;
Be thou as hasty, as my Sword will be
If thou refuse.
Why you are his son.
His son?
Swear, swear, thou worse then woman damned.
By all thats good you are.
Then art thou all that ever was known bad. Now is
The cause of all my strange misfortunes come to light:
What reverence expects thou from a child
To bring forth which thou hast offended Heaven,
Thy husband and the Land: Adulterous witch
I know now why thou would have poisoned me,
I was thy lust which thou would have forgot:
Thou wicked mother of my sins, and me,
Show me the way to the inheritance
I have by thee: which is a spacious world
Of impious acts, that I may soon possess it:
Plagues rot thee, as thou liu'st, and such diseases
As use to pay lust, recompense thy deed.
You doe not know why you curse thus.
Too well:
You are a pair of Vipers, and behold
The Serpent you have got; there is no beast
But if he knew, it has a pedigree
As brave as mine, for they have more descents,
And I am every way as beastly got,
As far without the compass of a law,
As they.
You spend your rage, and words in vain,
And rail upon a guess: hear vs a little.
No I will never hear, but talk away
My breath, and die.
Why but you are no Baftard.
Howe's that?
Nor child of mine.
Still you go on in wonders to me.
Pray be more patient, I may bring comfort to you.
I will kneel,
And hear with the obedience of a child;
Good Father speak, I doe acknowledge you,
So you bring comfort.
First know our last King your supposed Father
Was old and feeble when he married her,
And almost all the Land as she past hope
Of issue from him.
Therefore she took leave
To play the whore, because the King was old:
Is this the comfort?
what will you find out
To give me satisfaction, when you find
How you have injured me: let fire consume me,
If ever I were whore.
Forbear these starts,
Or I will leave you wedded to despair,
As you are now: if you can find a temper,
My breath shall be a pleasant western wind,
That cools, and blasts not.
Bring it out good Father,
Isle lie, and listen here as reverently
As to an Angel: If I breathe too loud,
Tell me; for I would be as still as night.
Our King I say was old, and this our Queen
Desired to bring an heir; but yet her husband
She thought was past it, and to be dishonest
I think she would not; if she would have been,
The truth is, she was watched so narrowly,
And had so slender opportunity,
She hardly could have been: But yet her cunning
Found out this way; she feigned her self with child,
And posts were sent in haste throughout the Land,
And God was humbly thanked in every Church,
That so had blessed the Queen, and prayers were made
For her safe going, and delivery:
She feigned now to grow bigger, and perceived
This hope of issue made her feared, and brought
A far more large respect from every man,
And saw her power increase, and was resolved,
Since she belieu'd she could not have it indeed;
At least she would be thought to have a child.
Doe I not hear it well; nay, I will make
No noise at all; but pray you to the point,
Quick as you can.
Now when the time was full,
She should be brought abed; I had a son
Borne, which was you: This the Queen hearing of,
Moved me to let her have you, and such reasons
She showed me as she knew would tie
My secrecy: she swear you should be King;
And o be short, • did deliue• you
Unto her, and pretended you we e dead;
And in mine own house kept a Funeral,
And had an emprie coffin put in earth:
That night the Queen feigned hastily to labour,
And by a pair of women of her own.
Which she had charmed, she made the world believe
She was delivered of you: you grew up
As the Kings son▪ till you were six year old;
Then did the King die, and did leave to me
Protection of the Realm; and contrary
To his own expectation, left this Queen
Truly with child indeed of the fair Princess
Panthaea: Then she could have torn her heir,
And did alone to me yet durst not speak
In publi•e; for she knew she should be found
A Traitor, and her talk would have been thought
Madness or any thing rather then truth:
This was the only cause why she did seek
To poison you, and I to keep you safe:
And this the reason why I sought to kindle
Some spark of love in you to fair Panthaea,
That she might get part of her right again.
And have you made an end now, is this all?
If not, I will be still till I am aged,
Till all my heirs are silver.
This is all.
And is it true say you Madam?
Yes God knows it is most true.
Panthaea t• en is not my Sister. Gob No.
But can you prove this?
If you will give consent: else who dare go about it.
Give consent?
Why I will have them all that know it racked
To get this from um: All that waits without
Come in, what ere you be come in, and be
Partakers of my Joy: O you are welcome.
Mardonius the best news, nay, draw no nearer
They all shall hear it: I am found no King.
Is that so good news?
Yes, the happiest news that ere was heard.
Indeed it were well for you,
If you might be a little less obeyed.
On, call the Queen.
Why she is there.
The Queen Mardonius, Panthaea is the Queen,
And I am plain Arbaces, go some one,
She is in Gobrius house; since I saw you
There are a thousand things delivered to me
You little dream of.
So it should seem: My Lord,
What furi's this.
Believe me tic no fury,
All that he says is truth.
Tic very strange.
Why doe you keep your hats off Gentlemen,
Is it to me? 〈◊〉 good faith it must not be:
I cannot now command you, but I pray you
For the respect you bare me, when you took
Me for your King, each man clap on his hat at my desire.
We will: but you are not found
So mean a man, but that you may be covered
As well as we, may you not?
O not here,
You may but not I, for here is my Father in presence,
Where?
Why there O the whole story
Would be a wilderness to loose thy self
For ever; O pardon me dear Father,
For all the idle, and irreverent words
That I have spoke in idle moods to you:
I am Arbaces, we all fellow subjects,
Nor is the Queen Panthaa now my Sister.
Why if you remember fellow subject Arbaces, I told you once she was not your sister, I say she looked nothing like you.
I think you did good Captain Bessus.
Here will arise another question now amongst the Swordmen, whether I be to call him to account for beating me, now he's proved no King.
Sir, here is Ligones
The Agent for the Armenian King.
Where is he, I know your business good Ligones,
We must have our King again, and will.
I knew that was your business, you shall have
Your King again, and have him so again
As never King was had. Go one of you
And bid Bacurius bring Tigranes hither,
And bring the Lady with him, that Panthaea
The Queen Panthaa sent me word this morning
Was brave Tigranes mistress.
Tic Spaconia.
I, I, Spaconia.
She is my daughter.
She is so, I could now tell any thing
I never heard; your King shall go so home
As never man went.
Shall he go on's head?
He shall have Chariots easier then ayre
That I will have invented; and ne'er think
He shall pay any ransom; and thy self
That art the Messenger shall ride before him
On a Horse cut out of an entire Diamond,
That shall be made to go with golden wheels,
I know not how yet.
Why I shall be made
For ever, they belied this King with vs
And savd he was unkind.
And then thy daughter,
She shall have some strange think, wele have the kingdom
Sold utterly, and put into a toy.
Which she shall wear about her carelessly
Some where or other.
See the virtuous Queen.
Behold the humblest subject that you have
Kneel here before you.
Why kneel you
To me that am your vassal?
Grant me one request.
Alas, what can I grant you?
What I can I will.
That you will please to marry me,
If I can prove it lawful.
Is that all?
More willingly, then I would draw this ayre.
Isle kiss this hand in earnest.
Sir, Tigranes is coming though he made it strange
To see the Princess any more.
The Queen,
Thou meanest: O my Tigranes pardon me,
Tread on my neck I freely offer it,
And if thou be so given; take revenge,
For I have injured thee.
No, I forgive,
And rejoice more that you have found repentance,
Then I my liberty.
Moist thou be happy
In thy fair choice; for thou art temperate:
You owe no ransom to the state, know that;
I have a thousand joys to tell you of,
which yet I dare not v•la, till I pay
My thanks to Heaven for um: will you go
with me, and ••l e me; pray you doe.
I will.
Take then your fair one with you, and your Queen
Of goodness, and of vs; O give me leave
To take your arm in mine: Come every one
That takes delight in goodness, help to sing
Loud thanks for me, that I am proved no King.
