GEntlemen, Inductions are out of date, and a Prologue in Verse is as stale, as a black Velvet Cloak, and a Bay Garland: There∣fore you shall have it plain Prose thus: If there be any amongst you, that come to hear lascivious Scenes, let them depart: for I doe pronounce this, to the utter discomfort of all two penny Gallery men, you shall have no bawdry in it: or if there bee any lurking amongst you in corners, with Table books, who have some hope to find fit matter to feed his — malice on, let them clasp them up, and slink away, or stay and be converted. For he that made this Play, means to please Auditors so, as hee may bee an Auditor him∣self hereafter, and not purchase them with the dear loss of his ears: I dare not call it Comedy, or Tra∣giddy; it is perfectly neither: A Play it is, which was meant to make you laugh, how it will please you, is not written in my part: For though you should like it to day, perhaps your selves know not how you should dis∣gest it to morrow: Some things in it you may meet with, which are out of the common Road: a Duke there is, and the Scene lies in Italy, as those two
things lightly wee never miss. But you shall not find in it the ordinary and overworn trade of jesting at Lords and Courtiers, and Citizens, without taxation of any particular or new vice by them found out, but at the persons of them: such, he that made this, thinks vile; and for his own part vows, That hee did never think, but that a Lord borne might bee a wise man, and a Cour∣tier an honest man.
Tic now the sweetest time for sleep, the night is scarce spent; Arrigo, what's a clock?
Past four.
Is it so much, and yet the morn not up?
See yōder where the shamfac'd maidē comes
Into our sight, how gently doth she slide,
Hiding her chaste cheeks, like a modest Bride,
With a red veil of blushes; as is she,
Even such all modest virtuous women be.
Why thinks your Lordship I am up so soon?
About some weighty State plot.
And what thinks your knighthood of it?
I doe think, to cure some strange corruptions in the common wealth.
You're well conceited of your selves, to think
I choose you out to bear me company
In such affairs and business of state:
But am not I a pattern for all Princes,
That break my soft sleep for my subjects good?
Am I not careful? very provident?
Your grace is careful.
Very provident.
Nay knew you how my serious working plots,
Concern the whole estates of all my subjects,
I and their lives; then Lucio thou would swear,
I were a loving Prince.
I think your grace intends to walk the pub∣lique streets disguised, to see the streets disorders.
It is not so.
You secretly will cross some other states, that doe conspire against you.
Weightier far:
You are my friends, and you shall have the cause;
I break my sleeps thus soon to see a wench.
You're wondrous careful for your subjects good.
You are a very loving Prince in deed.
This care I take for them, when their dull eyes,
Are closed with heavy slumbers.
Then you rise to see your wenches?
What Millaine beauty hath the power, to charm her Sovereigns eyes, and break his sleeps?
Sister to Count Vaelore: She's a maid
Would make a Prince, forget his throne and state,
And lowly kneel to her: the general fate
Of all mortality, is hers to give;
As she disposes, so we die and live.
My Lord, the day grow's clear, the Court will rise.
We stay too long, is the the Vmbranoes head as wee commanded, sent to the sad Gondarino, our general?
Tic sent.
But stay, where shines that light?
Tic in the chamber of Lazarello.
Lazarello? what is he?
A Courtier my Lord, and one that I wonder your grace knows not: for he hath followed your Court, and your last predecessors, from place to place, any time this seven year, as faithfully as your Spits and your Drip∣ping-pans have done, and almost as greasely.
O we know him as we have heard: he keeps a calendar of all the famous dishes of meat, that have bin in the Court, ever since our great Grandfathers time; and when he can thrust in at no Table, hee makes his meat of that.
The very same my Lord.
A Courtier call thou him?
Believe me Lucio, there be many such
About our Court, respected, as they think,
Even by our self; with thee I will be plain:
We Princes do use, to prefer many for nothing, and to take particular and free knowledge, almost in the nature of ac∣quaintance of many; whom we do use only for our plea∣sures, and do give largely to numbers; more out of polli∣cy, to be thought liberal, and by that means to make the people strive to deserve our love; then to reward any par∣ticular desert of theirs, to whom we give: and doo suffer our selves to here Flatterers, more for recreation
Then for love of it, though we seldom hate it:
And yet we know all these, and when we please,
Can touch the wheel, and turn their names about.
I wonder they that know their states so well, should fancy such base slaves.
Thou wondrest Lucio,
Dost not thou think, if thou were Duke of Millaine,
Thou should be flattered?
I know my Lord, I would not.
Why so I thought till I was Duke, I thought I should have left me no more Flatterers, then there are now plaine-dealers; and yet for all this my resolution, I am most palpably flattered: the poor man may loath cove∣tousnes &amp; flattery; but Fortune will alter the mind whē the wind turns: there may be well a little conflict, but it will drive the billows before it.
Arrigo it grow's late, for see fair Thetis hath undone the bares
To Phebus team; and his vnriual'd light,
Hath chased the mornings modest blush away:
Now must we to our love, bright Paphian Queen;
Thou Cytherean gods, that delights
In stirring glances, and art still thy self,
More toying then thy team of Sparrows bee;
Thou laughing Errecina O inspire
Her heart with love, or lessen my desire.
Go run, search, pry in every nook and Angle of the kitchens, larders, and pasteries, know what meate's boiled, baked, roast, stewed, fri'de, or soused, at this din∣ner to be served directly, or indirectly, to every several ta∣ble in the Court, be gone.
I run, but not so fast, as your mouth will doe up∣on the stroke of eleven.
What an excellent thing did God bestow upon man, when he did give him a good stomach? what un∣bounded graces there are powered upon them, that have the continual command of the very best of these bless∣sings? Tic an excellent thing to bee a Prince, hee is served with such admirable variety of fare; such innumerable choice of delicates, his tables are full fraught with most nourishing food, &amp; his cupbords heavy laden with rich wines; his Court is still filled with most pleasing vary∣ties: In the Summer, his palace is full of greene geese; and in Winter, it swarmeth woodcockes,
O thou Goddess of plenty
Fill me this day with some rare delicates,
And I will every year most constantly,
As this day celebrate a sumptuous feast,
If thou wilt send me victuals in thine honour;
And to it shall be bidden for thy sake,
Even al the valiant stomachs in the Court:
All short-cloak'd Knights, &amp; al crosse-garter'd gentlemē;
All pump and pantofle, foot-cloth riders;
With all the swarming generation
Of long stocks, short pained hose, &amp; huge stuffed dublets:
All these shall eat, and which is more then yet
Hath ere been seen, they shall be satisfied.
I wonder my Ambassador returns not!
Here I am Moister.
And welcome:
Never did that sweet Virgin in her smock,
Fair cheeked Andromeda, when to the rock
Her ivory limbs were chained, and straight before
A huge Sea monster, tumbling to the shore,
To have devoured her, with more longing sight
Expect the coming of some hardy Knight,
That might have quel'd his pride, and set her free,
Then I with longing sight have looked for thee.
Your Perseus is come Master, that will destroy him,
The very comfort of whole presence shuts
The monster hunger from your yelping guts
Brief boy, brief, discourse the service of each se∣uerall Table compendiously.
Here is a Bill of all Sir.
Give it me. A Bill of all the several services this day appointed for every Table in the Court:
I, this is it on which my hopes rely;
Within this paper all my joys are closed:
Boy open it, and read it with reverence.
For the Captain of the Guards Table, three chynes of Beef, and two jolls of Sturgeon.
A portly service, but gross, gross, proceed to the Dukes own Table, dear boy to the Dukes own Table.
For the Dukes own Table, the head of an Vmbrana
Is it possible! can Heaven bee so propitious to the Duke?
Yes, Isle assure you Sir, it is possible, Heaven is so propitious to him.
Why then he is the richest Prince alive:
He were the wealthiest Monarch in all Europe,
Had he no other Territories, Dominions, Provinces, Seats,
Nor Palaces, but only that Vmbranaes head.
It is very fresh and sweet sir, the fish was taken but this night, &amp; the head as a rare novelty appointed by spe∣ciall cōmandement for the dukes own Table, this dinner.
If poor unworthy I may come to eat Of this most sacred dish, I here do vow (If that blind huswife Fortune will bestow But means on me) to keep a sumptuous house, A board groaning under the heavy burden of the beasts that chews the cud, and the Foul that cutteth the ayre: I shall not like the table of a country Justice, be∣sprinkled over with all manner of cheap Sallets, sliced Beef, Giblets, and Pettitoes, to fill up room, nor should there stand any great, cumbersome, uncut up pies at the nether end filled with moss and stones, partly to make a show with, and partly to keep the lower mess from ea∣ting, nor shall my meat come in sneaking like the Cittie-seruice, one dish a quarter of an hour after one another gone, as if they had appointed to meet there, and had mi∣stooke the hour, nor should it like the new Court service come in, in hast, as if it fine would be gone again, all courses at once, like a hunting breakfast, but I would have my several courses, and my dishes well filed, my first course should bee brought in after the ancient manner, by a score of old bleere-ey'de Serving-men, in long blew coats, (marry they shall buy silk, facing, and buttons themselves) but that's by the way.
Moister the time call's on, will you be walking.
Follow boy, follow, my guts were half an hour since in the privy kitchen.
Faith brother I must needs go yonder.
And in faith sister what will you do yonder.
I know the Lady Honoria will be glad to see me.
Glad to see you, faith the Lady Honoria cares for you as she doth for all other young Ladies, shoe's glad to
see you, and will show you the privy Garden, and tel you how many gowns the Duchess had: Marry if you have ever an old uncle, that would be a Lord, or ever a kins∣man that hath done a murder, or committed a robbery, and will give good store of money to procure his par∣don, then the Lady Honoria will be glad to see you.
I, but they say one shall see fine fights at the Court.
Isle tell you what you shall see, you shall see ma∣ny faces of mans making, for you shall find very few as God left them: and you shall see many legs too; a∣amongst the rest you shall behold one pair, the feet of which, were in times past sockelesse, but are now through the change of time (that alters all things) very strangely become the legs of a Knight and a Courtier: another pair you shall see, that were heir apparent legs to a Glover, these legs hope shortly to bee honourable; when they pass by they will bow, and the mouth to these legs, will seem to offer you some Courtship; it will swear, but it will lye, hear it not.
Why, and are not these fine sights?
Sister, in seriousness you yet are young And fair, a fair young maid and apt.
Apt?
Exceeding apt, apt to be drawn to.
To what?
To that you should not be, it is no dispraise,
She is not bad that hath desire to ill,
But she that hath no power to rule that will:
For there you shall be wood in other kinds
Then yet your years have known, the chiefest men
Will seem to throw themselves
As vassailes at your service, kiss your hand,
Prepare you banquets, masks, shows, all enticements
That wit and lust together can devise,
To draw a Lady from the state of grace
To an old Lady widows Gallery;
And they will praise your virtues, beware that,
The only way to turn a woman whore,
Is to commend her chastity: you'll go?
I would go, if it were but only to show you, that I could be there, and be moved with none of these tricks.
Your servants are ready?
An hour since
Well, if you come off clear from this hot service,
Your praise shall be the greater. Farewell Sister.
Farewell Brother.
Once more, if you stay in the presence till candle∣light, keep on the foreside of the Curtain; &amp; do you hear, take heed of the old Bawd, in the cloth of Tissue-sleeues, and the knit Mittens. Farewell Sister.
Now am I idle, I would I had bin a Scholar, that I might a studied now: the punishment of meaner men is, they have too much to doe; our only misery is, that without company we know not what to doe; I must take some of the common courses of our Nobility; which is thu•: if I can find no company that likes me, pluck off my Hat∣band, throw an old Cloak over my face, and as if I would not bee known, walk hastily through the streets, till I be discovered; then there goes Count such a one, says one; there goes Count such a one, says another: Look how fast he goes, says a third; there's some great matters in hand questionless, says a fourth; when all my busi∣ness is to have them say so: this hath been used; or if I can find any company, Isle after dinner to the Stage, to see a Play; where, when I first enter, you shall have a murmur in the house, every one that does not know, cries, what Noble man is that; all the Gallants on the Stage rise, veil to me, kiss their hand, offer me their places: then I pick out some one, whom I please to grace among the rest, take his seat, use it, throw my cloak over my face, and laugh at him: the poor gentle∣man imagines himself most highly graced, thinks all the
Auditors esteem him one of my bosom friends, and in right special regard with me. But here comes a Gentle∣man, that I hope will make me better sport, then either street and stage fooleries.
This man loves to eat good meat, always provided hee do not pay for it himself: he goes by the name of the Hun∣garie Courtier; marry, because I think that name will not sufficiently distinguish him, for no doubt hee hath more fellows there, his name is Lazarello, he is none of these same ordinary eaters, that will devour three breakfasts, &amp; as many dinners, without any prejudice to their beavers, drinkings or suppers; but he hath a more courtly kind of hunger, and doth hunt more after novelty, then plenty, Isle ouer-heare him.
O thou most itching kindly appetite,
Which every creature in his stomach feels;
O leave, leave yet at last thus to torment me.
Three several Sallets have I sacrificed,
Bedewed with precious oil and vinegar
Already to appease thy greedy wrath. Boy.
Sir.
Will the Count speak with me.
One of his Gentlemen is gone to inform him of your coming Sir.
There is no way left for me to compass this Fish head, but by being presently made known to the Duke.
That will be hard Sir.
When I have tasted of this sacred dish,
Then shall my bones rest in my fathers tomb
In peace, then shall I dye most willingly,
And as a dish be served to satisfy
Deaths hunger, and I will be buried thus:
My Beer shall be a charger borne by four,
The coffin where I lye, a powdering tubbe,
Bestrewed with Lattice, and cool sallet herbs,
My winding sheet of Tanseyes, the black guard
Shall be my solemn mourners, and in stead
Of ceremonies, wholesome burial prayers:
A printed dirge in rhyme, shall bury me
In stead of tears, let them pour Capon sauce
Upon my hearse, and salt in stead of dust,
Manchets for stones, for other glorious shields
Give me a Voyder, and aboue my hearse
For a Trutch sword, my naked knife stuck up.
Master, the Count is here.
Where? my Lord I do beseech you.
You're very welcome sir, I pray you stand up, you shall dine with me.
I do beseech your Lordship by the love I still have borne to your honourable house.
Sir, what need all this? you shall dine with me, I pray rise.
Perhaps your Lordship takes me for one of these same fellows, that do as it were respect victuals.
O sir, by no means.
Your Lordship he's often promised, that when∣soever I should affect greatness, your own hand should help to raise me.
And so much still assure your self of.
And though I must confess, I have ever shunned popularity by the example of others, yet I do now feel my self a little ambitious, your Lordship is great, and though young, yet a privy Counsellor.
I pray you sir leap into the matter, what would you have me doe for you?
I would entreat your Lordship to make me known to the Duke.
When sir?
Suddenly my Lord, I would have you present me unto him this morning.
It shall be done, but for what virtues, would you have him take notice of you?
Your Lordship shall know that presently. It is pity of this fellow, he is of good wit, &amp; sufficient un∣derstāding,
whē he is not troubled with this greedy worm.
Faith, you may entreat him to take notice of me for any thing; for being an excellent Farrier, for playing well at Span-counter, or sticking knives in walls, for be∣ing impudent, or for nothing; why may not I bee a Fauo∣rite on the sudden, I see nothing against it.
Not so sir, I know you have not the face to bee a favourite on the sudden.
Why thē you shall present me as a gētlemā well qua∣lified, or one extraordinary seen in divers strāge mysteries.
In what Sir? as howe?
Marry as thus—
Yonders my old Spirit, that hath haunted me daily, ever since I was a privy Counsellor, I must be rid of him, I pray you stay there, I am a little buisie, I will speak with you presently.
You shall bring me in, and after a little other talk, taking me by the hand, you shall utter these words to the Duke: May it please your grace, to take note of a gentleman, well read, deeply learned, and thoroughly grounded in the hidden knowledge of all Sallets and pothearbs whatsoever.
Twill be rare, if you will walk before Sir, I will overtake you instantly.
Your Lordships ever.
This fellow is a kind of Informer, one that lives in Alehouses, and Taverns, and because hee perceives some worthy men in this land, with much labour &amp; great expense, to have discovered things dangerously hanging over the State; hee thinks to discover as much out of the talk of drunkards in Taphouses: hee brings me inform∣tions, picked out of broken words, in men's common talk, which with his malicious misapplication, hee hopes will seem dangerous, hee doth besides bring me the names of all the young Gentlemen in the City, that use Ordinaries, or Taverns, talking (to my thinking) only as the freedom of their youth teach thē, without any
further ends; for dangerous and seditious spirits, he is be∣sides an arrant whore-master, as any is in Millaine, of a lay man. I will not meddle with the Clergy, he is parcel Lawyer, &amp; in my conscience much of their religion, I must put upon him some piece of service; come hither Sir, what have you to do with me?
Little my Lord, I only come to know how your Lordship would employ me.
Observed you that gentleman, that parted from me but now.
I saw him now my Lord.
I was sending for your, I have talked with this mā, and I doe find him dangerous.
Is your Lordship in earnest?
Hark you sir, there may perhaps be some within care-shot.
Sirrha will you venture your life, the Duke hath sent the fish head to my lord?
Sir if he have not, kill me, do what you will with me.
How uncertain is the state of all mortal things? I have these Crosses from my Cradle, from my very Cra∣dl, in so much that I doe begin to grow desperate: For∣tune I do despise thee, do thy worst; yet when I do better gather my self together, I do find it is rather the part of a wise man, to prevent the storms of Fortune by stirring, then to suffer them by standing still, to power themselves upon his naked body. I will about it.
Who's within there?
Let this Gentleman out at the back door, forget not my instructions, if you find any thing dangerous; trouble not your self, to find out me, but carry your informations to the Lord Lucio, he is a man grave and well experienced in these businesses.
Your Lordships Servant.
Will it please your worship walk?
Sir I was coming, I will ouer-take you.
I will attend you over against the Lord Gonderi∣noes house.
You shall not attend there long.
Thither must I to see my loves face, the chaste fire∣gin head
Of a dear Fish, yet pure and vnderflowred,
Not known of man, no bred rough country hand,
Hath once touched thee, no Panders withered paw,
Nor an vn-napkind Lawyers greasy fist,
Hath once slubberd thee: no Ladies supple hand,
Washed o'er with urine, hath yet seized on thee
With her two nimble talents: no Court hand,
Whom his own natural filth, or change of air,
Hath bedecked with scabs, hath mart thy whiter grace:
O let it be thought lawful then for me,
To crop the flower of thy virginity.
This day I am for fools, I am all theirs,
Though like to our young wanton cockerd heirs,
Who doe affect those men aboue the rest,
In whose base company they still are best:
I doe not with much labour strive to be
The wisest ever in the company:
But for a fool, our wisdom oft amends,
As enemies doe teach vs more then friends.
My Lord:
Ha.
Here's one hath brought you a present.
From whom, from a woman? if it be from a wo∣man, bid him carry it back, and tell her shoe's a whore: what is it?
A Fish head my Lord.
What Fish head?
I did not ask that my lord.
W•ence co•es it?
From the Court.
O it is a Cods-head.
No my Lord, it is some strange head, it comes from the Duke.
Let it be carried to my Mercer, I doe owe him money for silks, stop his mouth with that.
Was there ever any man that hated his wife after death but I? and for her sake all women, women that were created only for the preservation of little dogs.
My Lord, the Counts sister being overtaken in the streets, with a great haile-storme, is light at your gate, and desires Rome till the storm be overpassed.
Is she a woman?
I my Lord I think so.
I have none for her then: bid her get her gone, tel her she is not welcome.
My Lord, she is now coming up.
She shall not come up, tell her any thing, tell her I have but one great room in my house, and I am now in it at the close stool.
Shoe's here my Lord.
O impudence of women, I can keep dogs out of my house, or I can defend my house against thieves, but I cannot keep out women.
Now Madam, what hath your Ladyship to say to me?
My Lord, I was bold to crave the help of your house against the storm.
Your Ladyships boldness in coming, will bee impudence in staying, for you are most unwelcome.
Oh my Lord!
Doe you laugh, by the hate I bear to you, tic true.
You're merry my Lord.
Let me laugh to death if I bee, or can bee whilst thou art here, or lives, or any of thy sex.
I commend your Lordship.
Doe you commend me? why doe you commend me? I give you no such cause: thou art a filthy impudent whore; a woman, a very woman.
Ha, ha, ha.
Begot when thy father was drunk.
Your Lordship hath a good wit.
How? what have I good wit?
Come my Lord, I have heard before of your Lordships merry vain in jesting against our Sex, which I being desirous to hear, made me rather choose your Lordships house, then any other, but I know I am well∣come.
Let me not live if you be: me thinks it doth not become you, to come to my house, being a strāger to you. I have no woman in my house, to entertain you, nor to show you your chamber; why should you come to me? I have no Galleries, nor banqueting houses, nor bawdy pictures to show your Ladyship.
Believe me, this your Lordships plains makes me think my self more welcome, then if you had sworn by all the pretty Court oaths that are, I had been well∣comer then your soul to your body.
Now shoe's in talking, treason will get her out, I durst sooner undertake to talk an Intelligencer out of the room, and speak more then he durst hear, than talk a woman out of my company.
My Lord, the Duke being in the streets, and the storm continuing, is entered your gate, and now com∣ming up.
The Duke! now I know your arrant Madame; you have plots and private meetings in hand: why do you choose my house, are you ashamed to go too't in the old coupling place, though it be less suspicious here; for no Christian will suspect a woman to be in my house, yet you may doe it cleanlier there, for there is a care had of those businesses; and wheresoever you remove, your great
maintainer and you shall have your lodgings directly op∣posit, it is but putting on your night-gowne, and your slippers; madame, you understand me?
Before I would not understand him, but now he speaks riddles to me indeed.
T'was a strange haile-storme.
T'was exceeding strange.
Good morrow to your grace.
Good morrow Gondarino.
Justice great Prince.
Why should you beg for justice, I never did you wrong; whats the offender?
A woman.
O I know your ancient quarrel against that sex; but what heinous crime hath she committed?
She hath gone abroad.
What? it cannot be.
She hath done it.
How? I never heard of any woman that did so before.
If she have not laid by that modesty
That should attend a virgin, and quite void
Of shame, hath left the house where she was borne,
As they should never doe; let me endure
The pains that she should suffer.
Hath she so? which is the woman?
This, this.
How Arrigo? Lucio?
I then it is a plot, no Prince alive
Shall force me make my house, a brothel house;
Not for the sins, but for the women's sake,
I will not have her in my doors so long:
Will they make my house as bawdy as their own are?
Is it not Oriana?
It is.
Sister to Count Valour?
The very same.
She that I love?
She that you love.
I doe suspect.
So doe I.
This fellow to be but a counterfeit,
One that doth seem to loath all woman kind,
To hate himself, because he hath some part
Of woman in him; seems not to endure
To see, or to bee seen of any woman,
Only, because he knows it is their nature
To wish to taste that which is most forbidden:
And with this show, he may the better compass
(And with far less suspicion) his base ends.
Upon my life it is so.
And I doe know,
Before his slain wife gave him that offence,
He was the greatest servant to that sex,
That ever was; what doth this Lady here
with him alone? why should he rail at her to me?
Because your grace might not suspect.
T'was so: I doe love her straingely;
I would fine know the truth: counsel me.
It falls out better then we could expect Sir, that we should find the Duke and my Lord Gondarino toge∣there, both which you desire to be acquainted with.
T'was very happy: Boy, go down into the kitchen, &amp; see if you can spy that same; I am now in some hope: I have me thinks a kind of fever upon me,
A certain gloominess within me, doubting as it were, betwixt two passions; there is no young maid, upon her wedding night, when her husband sets first foot in the bed, blushes, and looks pale again, oftner then I doe now. There is no Poet acquainted with more shakings &amp;
••akinges, towards the latter end of this new play, when hoe's in that case, that he stands peeping betwixt the cur∣taines, so fearfully, that a bottle of Ale cannot be opened, but he thinks some body hisses, then I am at this instant.
Are they in consultatiō, if they be, either my young Duke hath gotten some bastard, and is persuading my knight yonder, to father the child, and marry the wench, or else some Cock-pit is to be built.
My Lord? what noble mann's that?
His name is Lucio, tic hee that was made a Lord at the request of some of his friends for his wives sake, he af∣fects to bee a great States-man, and thinks it consists in night caps, and jewels, and tooth-pikes?
And whats that other?
A Knight Sir, that pleases the Duke to favour, &amp; to raise to some extraordinary fortunes, hee can make as good men as himself, every day in the week and doth—
For what was he raised.
Truly Sir, I am not able to say directly, for what; but for wearing of red breeches as I take it, hes a brave man, hee will spend three Knighthoods at a Supper without trumpets.
My Lord isle talk with him, for I have a friend, that would gladly receive the humour.
If he have the itch of Knighthood upon him, let him repair to that Physician, he will cure him: but I will give you a note; is your friend fat or lean?
Something fat.
T'will be the worse for him.
I hope thats not material.
Very much, for there is an imposte set upon Knighthoods, and your friend shall pay a Noble in the pound.
I do not like examinations,
We shall find out the truth more easily,
Some other way less noted, and that course,
Should not be used, till we bee sure to prove
Some thing directly, for when they perceive
Themselves suspected, they will then provide
More warily to answer.
Doth she know your Grace doth love her.
She hath never heard it.
Then thus my Lord;
Whats hee that walks alone so sadly with his hands behind him?
The Lord of the house, he that you desire to be acquainted with, hee doth hate women for the same cause that I love them.
Whats that?
For that which Apes want: you perceive me Sir?
And is hee sad, can hee be sad, that hath so rich a gem under his roof, as that which I do follow? What young Ladies that?
Which: Have I mine eye sight perfect, Tic my sister, did I say the Duke had a bastard? what should she make here with him, and his Council; she hath no pa∣pers in her hand, to petition to them, she hath never a husband in prison, whose release she might sue for: Thats a fine trick for a wench; to get her husband clapped up, that she may more freely, &amp; with less suspicion, visit the private studies of men in authority. Now I do discover their consultatiō, yon fellow is a Pander without al salua∣tion; But let me not condemn her too rashly, without weighing the matter; shees a young Lady, She went forth early this morning with a waiting woman, and a Page, or so: This is no garden house, in my conscience she went forth with no dishonest intent; for she did not pretend going to any sermon in the further end of the City: Neither went she to see any odd old Gentle∣woman, that mourns for the death of her husband, or the loss of her friend, and must have young Ladies come to comfort her: Those are the damnable Bawds, It was no set meeting certainly: for there was no wafer-wo∣man
with her, these three days, on my knowledge: Isle talk with her: Good more•ow my Lord.
You're welcome Sir: her's her brother come now to doe a kind office for his sister, is it not strange?
I am glad to meet you here Sister.
I thank you good Brother: and if you doubt of of the cause of my coming, I can Satisfy you.
No faith, I dare trust thee, I doe suspect thou art honest, for it is so rare a thing to bee honest amongst you, that some one man in an age, may perhaps suspect some two women to be honest, but never believe it verily.
Let your return be sudden.
Unsuspected by them.
It shall, so shall I best perceive they• Love, if there be any, Farewell.
Let me entreat your grace to stay a little,
To know a Gentleman, to whom your self
Is much beholding, he hath made the sport
For your whole Court these 8. years, on my knowledge.
His name?
Lazarello.
I heard of him this morning, which is he?
Lazarello, pluck up thy Spirits, thy fort•nes are now raising, the Duke calls for thee, and thou shalt be ac∣quainted with him.
He's going away, and I must of necessity stay here, upon business.
Tic all one, thou shalt know him first.
Stay a little, if hee should offer to take me away with him, and by that means I should loose that I seek for; but if he should, I will not go with him.
Lazarello the Duke stays, wilt thou loose this op∣portunitie?
How must I speak to him?
It was well thought of: you must not talk to him, as you do to an ordinary man, honest plain sense; but you must wind about him: for example, if hee should ask
you what a clock it is, you must not say; if it please your grace, tic nine, but thus; thrice three a clock, so please my Sovereign, or thus; look how many muses there doth dwell,
Upon the sweet banks of the learned Well;
And just so many strokes the clock hath struck,
And so forth, and you must now &amp; then enter into a de•scription.
I hope I shall doe it.
Come: May it please your grace to take note of a gentleman, well seen, deeply read, &amp; thoroughly groū∣ded in the hidden knowledge of all sallets and pothearbs whatsoever.
I shall desire to know him more inwardly.
I kiss the Oxe-hide of your Graces foot.
Very well: will your grace question him a little?
How old are you?
Full eight and twenty several Almanacs
Hath been compiled, all for several years,
Since first I drew this breath, four prentiships
Have I most truly served in this world:
And eight and twenty times hath Phoebus carre
Run out his yearly course since.
I understand you Sir.
How like an ignorant Poet he talks.
You are eight and twenty year old? what time of the day doe you hold it to be?
About the time that mortals whet their knives
On thresholds, on their shoe soles, and on stayres:
Now bread is grating, and the testy cooke
Hath much to doe now, now the Tables all.
It is almost dinner time?
Your grace doth apprehend me very rightly.
Your grace shall find him in your further cōferēce Grave, wise, courtly, &amp; scholar like, vnderstādingly read In the necessities of the life of man. He knows that man is mortal by his birth; He knows that men must dye, and therefore live;
He knows that man must live, and therefore eat,
 And if it shall please your grace, to accompany your self with him, I doubt not, but that hee will at the least, make good my commendations.
Attend vs Lazarello, we doe want
Men of such Action, as we have received you
Reported from your honourable friend.
Good my Lord stand betwixt me and my over∣throw, you know I am ti'd here, and may not depart, my gracious Lord, so weighty are the business of mine own, which at this time doe call upon me, that I will rather choose to die, then to neglect them.
Nay you shall well perceive, besides the virtues that I have already informed you off, he hath a stomach, which will stoop to no Prince alive.
Sir at your best leisure, I shall thy•st to s•e you.
And I shall hunger for it.
Till then farewell all.
Long life attend your Grace.
I doe not taste this sport, Arrigo, Lucio.
We doe attend.
His grace is gone, and hath left his Helen with me, I am no Pander for him, neither can I bee won with the hope of gain, or the itching desire of tasting my Lords lechery to him, to keep her at (my house) or bring her in disguise, to his bed Chamber.
The twynes of Adders, and of Scorpions
About my naked breast, will seem to me
More tickling then those clasps, which men adore;
The lustful, dull, ill spirited embraces
Of women; the much praised Amazons,
Knowing their own infirmities so well,
Made of themselves a people, and what men
They take amongst them, they condemn to die,
Perceiving that their folly made them fit
To live no longer, that would willingly
Come in the worthless presence of a woman.
I will attend, and see what my young Lord will doe with his sister.
My Lord; the fish head is gone again.
Whither.
I know whither my Lord.
Keep it from Lazarello: Sister shall I confer with you in private, to know the cause of the Dukes coming hither, I know he makes you acquainted with his business of State.
He satisfy you brother, for I see you are jealous of me.
Now there shall bee some course taken for her convey••ce.
Lazarello, thou art happy, thy carriage hath begot love, and that love hath brought forth fruits, thou art here in the company of a man honourable, that will help thee to taste of the bounties of the Sea, &amp; when thou hast so done, thou shalt retire thy self unto the Court, &amp; there taste of the delicates of the earth, and be great in the eyes of thy Sovereign: now no more shalt thou need to scramble for thy meat, nor remove thy stomach with the Court; but thy credit shall command thy hearts desire, and all novelties shall be sent as presents unto thee.
Good Sister, when you see your own time, will you return home.
Yes brother, and not before.
I will grow popular in this State, &amp; overthrow the fortunes of a number, that live by extortion.
Lazarello, bestir thy self nimbly and suddenly, and here me with patience. to hear.
Let me not fall from my self; speak I am bound
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear the fish head is gone, and we know not whither.
I will not curse, nor swear, nor rage, nor rail,
Nor with contempteous tongue, accuse my Fate;
Though I might justly do it, nor will I
Wish my self vncreated for this evil:
Shall I entreat your Lordship to be seen
A little longer in the company
Of a man crossed by Fortune.
I hate to leave my friend in his extremities.
It is noble in you, then I take your hand,
And do protest, I do not follow this
For any malice, or for private ends,
But with a love, as gentle and as chaste,
As that a brother to his sister bears:
And if I see this fish head yet unknown,
The last words that my dying father spake,
Before his eye-strings brake, shall not of me
So often be remembered, as our meeting,
Fortune attend me, as my ends are just,
Full of pure love, and free from servile lust.
Farewell my Lord, I was entreated to inuit your Lordship to a Ladies vpsitting.
O my ears, why Madame, will not you follow your brother, you are waited for by great mē, heel bring you to him.
I'm very well my Lord, you do mistake me, if you think I affect greater company then your self.
What madness possesses thee, that thou can imagine me a fit man to entertain Ladies; I tell thee, I do use to tear their hair, to kick them, and to twindge their noses, if they be not careful in avoiding me.
Your Lordship may descant upon your own be∣hauior as please you, but I protest, so sweet and courtly it appears in my eye, that I mean not to leave you yet.
I shall grow rough.
A rough carriage is best in a man, Isle dine with you my Lord.
Why I will starve thee, thou shalt have nothing.
I have heard of your Lordships nothing, Isle put that to the venture.
Well, thou shalt have meat, Isle send it to thee.
Isle keep no state my Lord, neither doe I morn, Isle dine with you.
Is such a thing as this allowed to live:
What power hath let thee loose upon the earth
To plague vs for our sins? out of my doors.
I would your Lordship did but see how well
This fury doth become you, it doth show
So near the life, as it were natural.
O thou damned woman, I will fly the vengeance
That hangs aboue thee, follow if thou dare.
I must not leave this fellow, I will torment him to madness,
To teach his passions against kind to move,
The more he hates, the more Isle seem to love.
Sir, what may be done by art shall be done,
I wear not this black cloak for nothing.
Perform this, help me to this great heir by lear∣ning, and you shall want no black cloaks, taffaties, silk∣grogerams, satins &amp; veluets are mine, they shall be yours; perform what you have promised, &amp; you shall make me a lover of Sciences, I will study the learned languages, &amp; keep my shop-booke in Latin.
Trouble me not now, I will not fail you within this hour at your shop.
Let Art have her course.
It is well spoken, Madonna.
Hast thou brought me any customers.
No.
What the devil dost thou in black.
As all solemn professors of settled courses, doe co∣for my knavery with it: will you marry a citizen, reason∣nobly rich, and unreasonably foolish, silks in his shop, money in his purse, and no wit in his head?
Out upon him, I could have bin otherwise then so, there was a Knight swore hee would have had me, if I would have lent him but forty shillings to have redeemed his cloak, to go to Church in.
Then your waistcoat waiter shall have him, cal herin?
Francessina?
Anon?
Get you to the Church, and shrive your self,
For you shall be richly married anon.
And get you after her, I will work upon my city∣zen whilst he is warm, I must nor suffer him to consult with his neighbours, the openest fools are hardly couse∣ned, if they once grow jealous.
Save me ye better powers, let me not fall
Between the loose embraces of a woman:
Heaven, if my sins be ripe grown to a head,
And must attend your vengeance: I beg not to divert my fate,
Or to reprive a while thy punishment
Only I crave, and hear me equal heavens,
Let not your furious rod, that must afflict me,
Be that imperfect piece of nature,
That art makes up, woman, unsatiate woman.
Had we not knowing souls, at first infused
To teach a difference, twixt extremes and goods?
Were we not made ourselves, free, vnconfin'd
Commanders of our own affections:
And can it be, that this most perfect creature,
This image of his maker, well squared man,
Should leave the handfast, that he had of grace,
To fall into a women's easy arms.
Now Venus be my speed, inspire me with all the several subtle temptations, that thou hast already given, or hast in store hereafter to bestow upon our sex: grant that I may apply that Physic that is most apt to work upon him: whether he will soonest bee moved with wan∣tonnes, singing, dancing, or being passionate, with scorn, or with sad and serious looks, cunningly mingled with sighs, with smiling, lisping, kissing the hand, and making short curses; or with whatsoever other nimble power, he may bee caught: doe thou infuse into me, and when I have him, I will sacrifice him up to thee.
It comes again; new apparitions,
And tempting spirits: Stand and reveal thy self,
Tell why thou follow me? I fear thee
As I fear the place thou came from: Hell.
My Lord, I am a woman, and such a one—
That I hate truly, thou had better bin a devil. women.
Why my vnpatient Lord?
Devils were once good, there they excelled you
Can ye be so uneasy, can ye freeze, and
Such a summers heat so ready
To dissolve, nay gentle Lord, turn not away in scorn,
Nor hold me less fair then I am: look on these checks,
They have yet enough of nature, true complexion,
If to be red and white, a forehead hie,
An easy melting lip, a speaking eye,
And such a tongue, whose language takes the ear
Of strict religion, and men most austere:
If these may hope to please, look here.
This woman with entreaty wo'd show all,
Lady there lies your way, I pray ye farewell.
You're yet to harsh, to dissonant.
Ther's no true music in your words, my Lord.
What shall I give thee to be gone?
Hears ta, and tha wants lodging, take my house, tic big e∣nough, tic shine own, t'will hold five lecherous Lords, &amp; their lackeys without discovery: ther's stoues and bathing tubbs.
Dear Lord: you're too wild.
Shat have a Doctor too, thou shat, about six and twenty, tic a pleasing age; or I can help thee to a handsome usher: or if thou lack'ft a page, isle give thee one, prithee keep house, and leave me.
I doe confess I am to easy, too much woman,
Not coy enough to take affection,
Yet I can frown and nip a passion
Even in the bud: I can say
Men please their present heats; Then please to leave vs.
I can hold off, and by my Chimmick power
Draw Sonnets, from the melting lovers brain.
Aims, and Elegies: yet to you my Lord
My Love, my better self, I put these off,
Doing that office, not befits our sex,
Entreat a man to love;
Are ye not yet relenting, ha'ye blood and Spirit
In those veins, ye are no Image, though ye bee as hard.
As marble, sure ye have no liver, if ye had,
'T would send a lively and desiring heate
To every member; is not this miserable,
A thing so truly formed, shaped out by Symmetry,
Has all the organs that belong to man,
And working to, yet to show all these
Like dead motions moving, upon wires,
Then good my Lord, leave off what you have been,
And freely be what you were first intended for: a man.
Thou art a precious piece of sly damnation,
I will be deasfe, I will locke up my ears,
Tempt me not, I will not love; if I doe,
Then isle hate you.
Let me be nointed with honey, and turned into the Sun,
To be stung to death with horse-flies,
Heart thou, thou breeder, here isle sit,
And in despite of thee I will say nothing.
Let me with your fair patience, sit beside you?
Madam, Lady, tempter, tongue, woman, ayre,
Look to me, I shall kick; I say again,
Look to me I shall kick.
I cannot think your better knowledge can use a woman so uncivilly.
I cannot think, I shall become a coxcomb,
To have my hare curled, by an idle finger,
My cheeks turn Tabers, and be plaid upon,
Mine eyes looked babies in, &amp; my nose blowd to my hand, mind
I say again I shall kick, sure I shall.
Tic but your outside that you show: I know your
Never was guilty of so great a weakness,
Or could the tongues of all men joined together
Possess me with a thought of your dislike
My weakness were aboue a women's, to fall off
From my affection, for one crack of thunder,
O wo'd you could love my Lord.
I wot thou would sit still, and say nothing: what mad-man let thee loose to do more mischief then a dozen whirlwinds, keep thy hands: in thy muff, and warm the idle worms in thy fingers ends will ye bee doing still, will no entreating serve ye, no lawful warning, I must remove and leave your Ladyship; nay never hope to stay me, for I will run, from that Smooth, Smiling, witching, Cozening, Tempting, Damning face of thine, as far as I can find any land, where I will put my self into a daily course of Curses for thee, and all thy Family.
Nay good my Lord sit still, isle promise peace
And fouled mine Arms up, let but mine eye discourse,
Or let my voice set to some pleasing corde, sound out
The sullen strains of my neglected love.
Sing till thou crack thy treble string in pieces,
And when thou hast done, put up thy pipes and walk,
Doe any thing, sit still and tempt me not.
I had rather sing at doors for bread, then sing to this fellow, but for hate: if this should be told in the Court, that I begin to woe Lords, what a troop of the untrust no∣bilitie should I have at my lodging tomorrow morning.
Come sleep, and with thy sweet deceiving,
Lock me in delight a while,
Let some pleasing Dreams beguile
All my fancies that from thence,
I may feel an influence,
All my powers of care bereaving.
Though but a shadow, but a sliding,
Let me know some little Joy,
We that suffer long annoy
Are contented with a thought
Through an idle fancy wrought
O let my joys, have some abiding.
Have you done your wassail, tic a handsome drowsy ditty isle assure ye, now I had as leeue here a Carte cry, when her tail is cut off, as hear these lemon∣tations, these lousy loue-layes, these beway laments, you think you have caught me Lady, you think I melt now, like a dish of May butter, and run, all into brine, and passion, yes, yes, I am taken, look how I cross my arms, look pale, and dwindle, and wooed cry, but for spoiling my face, we must part, nay we will avoid all Cere∣money, no kissing Lady, I desire to know your Ladyship no more; death of my soul the Duke.
God keep your Lordship.
From thee and all thy sex.
Isle be the Clarke and cry Amen,
Your Lordships ever assured enemy Oriana.
All the days good, attend your Lordship.
We thank you Gonderino, is it possible,
Can belief lay hold on such a miracle,
To see thee, one that hath cloystred up all passion,
Turned wilful votary, and forsworn, converse with wo∣men
in company and fair discoure, with the best beauty of Myllaine?
Tic true, and if your Grace that hath the sway
Of the whole State, will suffer this lewd sex,
These women, to pursew vs to our homes,
Not to be pried, nor to be railed away,
But they will woe, and dance, and sing,
And in a manner, looser then they are
By nature (which should seem impossible)
To throw their arms, on our unwilling necks.
No more, I can see through your visor, dissemble it no more,
Doe not I know thou hast used all Art,
To work upon the poor simplicity
Of this young Maid, that yet hath known none ill?
Think that damnation will fright those that woo
From oaths, and lies? but yet I think her chaste,
And will from thee, before thou shalt apply
Stronger temptations, bear her hence with me.
My Lord, I speak not this to gain new grace,
But howsoever you esteem my words,
My love and duty will not suffer me
To see you favour such a prostitute,
And I stand by dumb; without Rack, Torture,
Or Strappado, Isle vnrippe my self,
I doe confess I was in company, with that pleasing piece of frailty, that we call woman; I doe confess after along and tedious siege, I yielded.
Forward.
Faith my Lord to come quickly to the point, the woman you saw with me is a whore; an arrant whore.
Was she not Count Valores Sister?
Yes, that Count Valores Sister in nought.
Thou dare not say so.
Not, if it be distasting to your Lordship, but give me freedom, &amp; I dare maintain, she he's embraced this body, and grown to it as close, as the hot youthful vine to the elm.
Twice have I seen her with thee twice my thoughts were prompted by mine eye, to hold thy strictness false and imposterous: is this your mewing up, your strict re∣tirement, your bitterness and gaul against that sex: have I not heard thee say, thou would sooner meet the Basilisks dead doing eye, then meet a woman for an object: look it be true you tell me, or by our countries Saint your head goes off: if thou prove a whore, no women's face shall ever move me more.
So, so, it is as it should be, are women grown so mankind? Must they be wooing, I have a plot shall blow her up, she flies, she mounts, Isle teach her Ladyship to dare my fury, I will be known and feared, and more truly hated of women then an Eunuch.
Shees here again, good gaul be patient, for I must dis∣semble.
Now my cold frosty Lord, my woman Hater, you that have sworn an everlasting hate to all our sex: by my troth good Lord, and as I am yet a maid, my thought it was excellent sport to hear your honour swear out an Al∣phabet, chafe nobly like a General, kick like a resty jade and make ill faces: Did your good Honour think I was in love? where did I first begin to take that heat? from those two radiant eyes, that piercing sight? oh they were lovely, if the balls stood right; and there's a leg made out of a dainty staff, Where the Gods be thanked, there is calfe enough.
Pardon him Lady that is now a convertite,
Your beauty like a Saint hath wrought this wonder.
A lass, he's it been prick't at the heart, is the stomach come down, will it rail no more at women, and call 'em Devils, she Cattes, and Gob∣blins.
Hee that shall marry thee, had better spend the poor remainder of his days in a Dung-barge, for two pence a week, and find himself:
Down again Spleen, I prithee down again, shall I find favour Lady? shall at length my true unfeigned pene∣tence get pardon for my harsh unseasoned follies? I am no more an Atheist, no, I doe acknowledge, that dread powerful Deity, and his all quickening heats, burn in my breast: oh be not as I was, hard, unrelenting; but as I am, be partner of my Fires.
Sure we shall have store of Larks, the Skies will not hold up long, I should have looked as soon for frost in the dog days, or an other Inundation, as hoped this strange conversion aboue miracle: let me look upon your Lordship; is your name Gondarino, are you Millaines General, that great Bug-beare bloodie-bones, at whose very name all women, from the Lady to the Laundress, shake like a cold fit.
Good patience help me, this Fever will enrage my blood again: Madam I am that man; I am even hee, that once did owe vnreconciled hate to you, and all that bear the name of woman: I am the man, that wronged your honour to the Duke, I am hee that said you were un∣chaste, and prostitute; yet I am he, that dare deny all this.
Your big Nobility is very merry.
Lady tic true that I have wronged you thus,
And my Contrition is as true as that,
Yet have I found a means to make all good again,
I doe beseech your beauty, not for my self,
My merits are yet in conception,
But for your honours safety, and my zeal
Retire a while, whilst I unsay my self unto the Duke,
And cast out that evil Spirit, I have possessed him with,
I have a house conveniently private.
Lord, thou hast wronged my innocence, but thy confession hath gained thee faith.
By the true honest service, that I owe those eyes, strangely,
My meaning is as spotless as my faith.
The Duke doubt mine honour? a may judge
Twill not be long, before isle be enlarged again.
A day or two.
Mine own servants shall attend me.
Your Ladyships command is good.
Look you be true.
EIse let me lose the hopes my soul aspires to: I will be a scourge to all females in my life, and after my death, the name of Gondarino shall be terrible to the mighty women of the earth; they shall shake at my name, and at the sound of it, their knees shall knock together; and they shall run into Nunneries, for they and I are beyond all hope irreconcilable: for if I could endure an ear with a hole in it, or a pleated locke, or a bare-headed Coachman, that sits like a sign, where great Ladies are to bee sold within; agreement betwixt vs, were not to bee despaired of; if I could bee but brought to endure to see women, I would have them come all once a week and kiss me, where Witches doe the devil in token of homage: I must not live here, I will to the Court, and there pursue my plot; when it hath took, women shall stand in awe, but of my look.
There take your standing, be close and vigilāt, here will I set my self, and let him look to his language, a shall know the Duke he's more ears in Court than two.
Isle quote him to a tittle, let him speak wisely, and plainly, and as hidden as a can, or I shall crush him, a shall not scope characters, though a speak Babel, I shall crush him: we have a Fortune by this service hanging over vs, that within this year or two, I hope we shall be called to be examiners, wear politic gowns guarded with cop∣per lace, making great faces full of fear and office, our labours may deserve this.
I hope it shall: why he's not many men bin raised from this worming trade, first to gain good access to great men, then to have commissions out for search, and
lastly, to be worthily named at a great Arraignment: yes, &amp; why not we? they that endeavour well deserve their Fee. Close, close, a comes: mark well, and all goes well.
Farewell my hopes, my Anchor now is broken,
Farewell my quondam joys, of which no token
Is now remaining, such is the sad mischance,
Where Lady Fortune leads the slippry dance.
Yet at the length, let me this favour have,
Give me my wishes, or a wished grave.
The gods defend so brave and valiant maw,
Should slip into the never satiate jawe
Of black Despair; no, thou shalt live and know
Thy full desires, hunger thy ancient foe,
Shall be subdued, those guts that daily tumble
Through ayre and appetite, shall cease to rumble:
And thou shalt now at length obtain thy dish,
That noble part, the sweet head of a fish.
Then am I greater then the Duke.
There, there's a notable piece of treason, greater then the Duke, mark that.
But how, or where, or when this shall bee com∣pas'd, is yet out of my reach.
I am so truly miserable, that might I be now knocked ath' head, with all my heart I would forgive a dog killer.
Yet doe I see through this confusednes some lit∣tle comfort.
The plot my Lord, as ever you cam of a womā discover.
Plots, dangerous plots, I will deserve by this most liberally.
It is from my head again.
O that it would stand me, that I might fight, or have some venture for it, that I might be turned loose, to try my Fortune amongst the whole fry in a College, or an Inn of Court, or scrāble with the prisoners in the dun∣geon; nay were it set down in the outer court,
And all the Guard about it in a ring,
With their knives drawn, which were a dismal sight,
And after twenty leisurely were told,
I to be let loose, only in my shirt,
To try the valour, how much of the spoil,
I would recover from the enemies mouths:
I would accept the challenge.
Let it go: hast not thou been held
To have some wit in the Court, and to make fine jests
Upon country people in progress time, and
Wilt thou loose this opinion, for the cold head of a Fish?
I say, let it go: Isle help thee to as good a dish of meat.
God let me not live, if I doe not wonder
Men should talk so profanely:
But it is not in the power of loose words,
Of any vain or misbelieving man,
To make me dare to wrong thy purity,
Show me but any Lady in the Court,
That hath so full an eye, so sweet a breath,
So soft and white a flesh: this doth not lie
In almond gloves, nor ever hath bin washed
In artificial bathes; no traveller
That hath brought doctor home with him, hath dared
With all his waters, powders, Fucusses,
To make thy lovely corpse sophisticate.
I have it, tic now infused, be comforted.
Can there be that little hope yet left in nature? shall I once more erect up Trophies? shall I enjoy the sight of my dear Saint, and bless my palate with the best of creatures, ah good my Lord, by whom I breath again, shall I receive this being?
Sir, I have found by certain calculation, and set∣led revolution of the stars, the Fish is sent by the Lord Gondarino to his Mercer, now tic a growing hope to know where tic.
O tic far aboue the good of women, the Pathicke cannot yield more pleasing titillation.
But how to compass it, search, east about, and
bang your brains, Lazarello, thou art to dull and heavy to deserve a blessing.
My Lord, I will not be idle; now Lazarello, think, think, think.
Yonders my Informer
And his fellow with table books, they nod at me
Upon my life, they have poor Lazarello that beats
His brains about no such weighty matter, in for
Treason before this—
My Lord, what doe you think, if I should shave my self, Put on midwives apparel, come in with a hand-kercher, And beg a piece for a great bellied womā, or a sick child?
Good, very good.
Or corrupt the waiting prentice to betray the re∣uersion.
Ther's another point in's plot, corrupt with mo∣ney to betray: sure it is some Fort a means: mark, have a care.
And it were the bare vinegar it is eaten with, it would in some sort satisfy nature: but might I once at∣taine the dish it self, though I cut out my means through swords and fire, through poison, through any thing that may make good my hopes.
Thanks to the gods, and our officiousness, the plots discovered, fire, steel, and poison, burn the Palace, kill the Duke, and poison his privy Counsel.
To the mercers, let me see: how if before we can attain the means, to make up our acquaintāce, the fish be eaten?
If it be eaten, here a stāds, that is the most dejected, most unfortunate, miserable, accursed, forsaken slave, this Province yields: I will not sure outlive it, no I will die bravely, and like a Roman; and after death, amidst the E∣lizian shades, Isle meet my love again.
I will die bravely, like a Roman: have a care, mark that: when he hath done all, he will kill himself.
Will no thing ease your appetite but this?
No could the sea throw up his vastness,
And offer free his best inhabitants: it were not so much as a bare temptation to me.
If you could be drawn to affect Beef, Venison, or Foul, two•lt be far the better.
I doe beseech your Lord•hips patience,
I doe confess that in this heat of blood,
I have contemned all dull and grosser meats,
But I protest, I doe honour a Chine of beef,
I doe reverence a loin of veale,
But good my Lord, give me leave a little to adore this:
But my good Lord, would your Lordship under colour
of taking up some silks, go to the Mercers, I would in
all humility attend your honour, where we may be invited,
if Fortune stand propitious.
Sir you shall work me as you please.
Let it be suddenly, I doe beseech your Lordship, it is now upon the point of dinner time.
I am all yours.
Come let vs confer, Inprimis a saith like a blasphemous villain, he is greater thē the Duke, this pepers him, &amp; there were nothing else.
Then a was naming plots; did ye not hear?
Yes but a fell from that, unto discovery, to cor∣rupt by money, and so attain.
I, I, a meant some Fort, or Syttadell the Duke hath, his very face betrayed his meaning, O hee is a very subtle and a dangerous knave, but if a deal a Gods name we shall worm him.
But now comes the Stroke, the fatal blow, Fire, sword, &amp; Poison, O Canibal, thou bloody Canibal.
What had become of this poor state, had not we been?
Faith it had lain buried in •his own ashes; had not a greater hand been in it.
But note the Rascals resolution, after th'acts done, because a wo'd avoid al fear of torture, and cousin the Law, a wo'd kill himself? was there ever the like danger, brought to light in this age? sure we shall merit much, we shall be able to keep two men a piece, &amp; a two hand sword
between vs, we will live in favour of the State, betray our ten or twelve treasons a week, and the people shall fear vs: come, to the Lord Lucio, the Sun shall not go down till a be hanged.
Look to my shop, &amp; if there come ever a School∣ler in black, let him speak with me, we that are shop-kee∣pers in good trade, are so pestered, that we can scarce pick out an hour for our mornings meditation: &amp; howsoever we are all accounted dull, and common jesting stocks, for your gallants; there are some of vs, doe not deserve it: for for my own part, I doe begin to bee given to my book, I love a scholar with my heart; for questionless there are marvelous things to bee done by Art: why sir, some of thē will tel you what is become of horses, &amp; silver spones, &amp; will make wenches dance naked to their beds: I am yet unmarried, and because some of our neighbours are said to be Cuckolds, I will never marry without the consent of some of these scholars, that know what will cōe of it.
Are you busy sir?
Never to you sir, nor to any of your coat. Sir is there any thing to bee done by Art, concerning the great heir we talked on?
Will she, will she? she shall come running into my house at the farther corner, in Sa. Marks street, be∣twixt three and four.
Betwixt three and four? shoe's brave in clothes; is she not?
O rich! rich! where should I get clothes to dress her in? help me invention: Sir, that her running through the street, may be less noted, my Art more shown, and your fear to speak with her less, she shall come in a white wastcote, And—
What shall she?
And perhaps torn stockings, she hath left her old wont else.
Sir my Lord Gonde. hath sent you a rare fish head.
It comes right, all things suit right with me, since I
began to love scholars, you shall have it home with you, against she come: carry it to this Gentleman's house.
The fair white house at the farther Corner at S. Marks street, make hast, I must leave you too Sir. I have two hours to study; buy a new Axidens, &amp; ply your book, and you shall want nothing, that all the scholars in the Town can doe for you.
Heaven prosper both our studdies, what a dull slave was I, before I fell in love with this learning? not worthy to tread upon the earth, and what fresh hopes it •ath put into me? I doe hope within this twelve month, to be able by Art, to serve the Court with silks, and not undo my self; to trust knights, and yet get in my money again; to keep my wife brave, and yet she keep no by∣die else, so.
Your Lordship is most honourably welcome, in regard of your Nobility, but most especially in regard of your scholarship: did your Lordship come openly?
Sir this cloak keeps me private, besides no man will suspect me to bee in the company of this Gen∣tleman, with whom, I will desire you to bee acquainted, he may prove a good customer to you.
For plain silks and veluets.
Are you scholasticall?
Something addicted to the Muses.
I hope they will not dispute.
You have no skill in the black Art?
Sir yonders a Gentleman, enquires hastily for Count Valour.
For me? what is he?
One of your followers my Lord I think.
Let him come in.
Shall I talk with you in private Sir?
CountCome to the Court, your business calls you thither,
I will go, farewell Sir, isle see your silks some other time: Farewell
Lazarillo.
Will not your Lordship take a piece of Beef with me?
Sir I have greater business then eating; I will leave this gentlemā with you.
No, no, no, no: now doe I feel that strained strug∣ling within me, that I think I could prophecy.
The Gentleman is meditating.
Hunger, valour, Love, ambition, are alike plea∣sing, and let our Philosophers say what they will, are one kind of heat, only hunger is the safest, ambition is apt to fall; Love and valour are not free from dangers, only hunger, begotten of some old limber Courtier, in pan'd hose, and nursed by an Attorneys wife, now so thryuen, that he need not fear to be of the great Turks guard: is so free from al quarrels, and dangers, so full of hopes, joys, and ticklings, that my life is not so dear to me, as his acquaintance.
Sir, the fish head is gone.
Then be thou henceforth dumb, with thy ill by∣ding voice
Farewell Millaine, fare well noble Duke,
Farewell my fellow Courtiers all, with whom,
I have of yore made many a scrambling meal
In corners, behind Arasses, on stairs,
And in the action often times have spoiled,
Our Dublets and our hose, with liquid stuff:
Farewell you lusty archers of the Guard,
To whom I now doe give the bucklers up,
And never more with any of your coat
Will eat for wagers, now you happy be,
When this shall light upon you, think on me:
You Sewers, carvers, ushers of the Court
Surnamed gentle, for your fair demean,
Here I doe take of you my last farewell,
May you stand stiffly in your proper places,
And execute your offices aright.
Farewell you maidens, with your mother eke,
Farewell you courtly Chaplains that be there,
All good attend you, may you never more
Marry your Patrons Ladies wayting-woman,
But may you raised bee; by this my fall
May Lazarillo suffer for you all.
Sir, I was harkening to you.
I will hear nothing; I will break my knife, the ensign of my former happy state, knock out my teeth, have them hung at a Barbers, and enter into Religion.
Why Sir, I think, I know whether it is gon.
See the rashness of man in his nature; whither? whither? I doe unsay •• that I have said, go on, go on: Boy, I humble my self and follow thee; Farewell sir.
Not so Sir, you shall take a piece of Beef with me.
I cannot stay.
By my fey, but you shall Sir; in regard of your love to learning, and your skill in the black Art.
I do hate learning, and I have no skill in the black Art; I would I had.
Why your desire is sufficient to me, you shall stay.
The most horrible, and detested curses that can be imagined; light upon all the professors of that Art; may they be drunk, &amp; when they go to cōjure, &amp; reel in the Circle, may the Spirits by them raised, tear am in pieces, and hang their quarters on old broken walls, and Steeple tops.
This speech of yours, shows you to have some skill in the Science, wherefore in civility, I may not suffer you to depart empty.
My stomach is up, I cannot endure it, I will fight in this quarrel, as soon as for my Prince. Room, make way:
Hunger commands, my valour must obey.
Is the Duke private?
He is alone, but I think your Lordship may en∣la.
Who's with the Duke?
The Count is new gone in, but the Duke will come forth, before you can be weary of waiting.
I will attend him here.
I must wait without the door.
Doth he hope to clear his sister, she will come no more to my house, to laugh at me: I have sent her to a habitation, where when she shall be seen, it will set a gloss upon her name; yet upon my soul I have bestowed her amongst the purest hearted creatures of her sex, and the freest from dissimulation; for their deeds are all alike, on∣lie they dare speak, what the rest think: the women of this age, if there bee any degrees of comparison amongst their sex, are worse then those of former times; for I have read of women, of that truth, spirit, and constancy, that were they now living, I should endure to see them: But I fear the writers of the time, belied them, for how familiar a thing is it with the Poets of our age, to extol their whores, which they call mistresses, with heavenly praises? but I thank their furies, and their crazed brains, beyond belief: nay how many that would fine seem serious, have dedicated grave works to ladies tooth-lesse, hollow eyed, their hair shedding, purple faced, their nails appa∣rantly coming off; and the bridges of their noses bro∣ken down; and have called thē the choice handy works of nature, the patterns of perfection, and the wondermēt of women. Our women begin to swarm like Bees in Summer: as I came hither, there was no pair of stairs, no entry, no lobby, but was pestered with them: me thinks there might bee some course taken to destroy them.
I doe accept your money, walk here, and when the Duke comes out, you shall have fit opportunity to
deliver your petition to him.
I thank you heartily, I pray you who's he that walks there?
A Lord, and a Soldier, one in good favour with the Duke; if you could get him to deliver your Petition—
What do you say Sir?
If you could get him to deliver your petition for you, or to second you, it were sure.
I hope I shall live to requite your kindness.
You have already.
May it please your Lordship—
No, No.
To consider the estate—
No.
Of a poor oppressed Country Gentlewoman.
No, it doth not please my Lordship.
First and foremost, I have had great injury, then I have been brought up to the Town three times.
A pox on him, that brought thee to the Town.
I thank your good Lordship heartily; though I cannot hear well, I know it grieves you; and here wee have been delayed, and sent down again, and fetched up again, and sent down again, to my great charge: And now at last they have fetched me up, and five of my daughters—
Enough to damn five worlds.
Handsome young women, though I say it, they are all without, if it please your Lordship, Isle call them in.
Five women! how many of my senses should I have left me then? call in five Devils first.
No, I will rather walk with thee alone,
And hear thy tedious tale of injury,
And give thee answers; whisper in thine ear,
And make thee understand; through thy French-hood:
And all this with tame patience.
I see your Lordship does believe, that they are without, and I perceive you are much moved at our in∣jury: her's a paper will tell you more.
A way.
It may bee you had rather here me tell it viva voce, as they say.
O no, no, no, no, I have heard it before.
Then you have heard of enough injury, for a poor Gentlewoman to receive.
Never, never, but that it troubles my conscience, to wish any good to those women; I could afford them to bee valiant, and able, that it might be no disgrace for a Soldier to beat them.
I hope your Lordship will deliver my petition to his grace, and yoo may tell him withal—
What, I will deliver any thing against my self, to be rid on thee.
That yesterday, about three a clock, in the after noon, I met my adversary.
Give me thy paper, he can abide no long tales.
It is very short my Lord, and I demanding of him —
Isle tell him that shall serve thy turn.
How?
Isle tell him that shall serve thy turn, be gone: man never doth remember how great his offences are, till hee doe meet with one of you, that plagues him for them: why should women only aboue all other creatures that were created for the benefit of mā, have the use of speech? or why should any deed of theirs, done by their fleshly ap∣petites, be disgraceful to their owners? nay, why should not an act done by any beast I keep, against my consent, disparage me as much as that of theirs?
Here's some few Angels for your Lordship.
Again? yet more torments?
Indeed you shall have them.
Keep off.
A small gratuit for your kindness.
Hold away.
Why then I thank your Lordship, Isle gather thē up
again, and Isle bee sworn, it is the first money, that was refused, since I came to the court.
What can she devise to say more?
Truly I would have willingly parted with them to your Lordship.
I believe it, I believe it.
But since it is thus—
More yet.
I will attend without, and expect an answer.
Doe, begone, and thou shalt expect, and have any thing, thou shalt have thy answer from him; and he were best to give thee a good one at first, for thy deaf impor∣tunitie, will conquer him too, in the end.
God bless your Lordship, &amp; all that favour poor distressed country gentlewoman.
All the diseases of man, light upon them that doe, and upon me when I doe; a week of such days, would ei∣there make me stark mad, or tame me: yonder other wo∣man that I have sure enough, shall answer for thy sins: dare they incense me still, I will make them fear as much to be ignorant of me and my moods, as men are to bee ignorant of the law they live under. Who's there? My blood grew cold, I began to fear my Suitors return; tic the Duke.
I know her chaste, though she be young &amp; free,
And is not of that forced behaviour
That many others are, and that this Lord,
Out of the boundless malice to the sex,
Hath thrown this scandal on her.
Fortune, befriended me against my will, with this good old country gentlewomā; I beseech your grace, to view favourably the petition of a wrōged gentlewomā.
What Gondarino, are you become a petitioner for your enemies?
My Lord, they are no enemies of mine, I confess the better to cover my deeds, which sometimes were loose
enough, I pretended it, as it is wisdom, to keep close our incontinence; but since you have discovered me, I will no more put on that visor, but will as freely open all my thoughts to you, as to my Confessor.
What say you to this?
He that confesses, he did once dissemble,
Isle never trust his words, can you imagine
A maid, whose beauty could not suffer her
To live thus long vntempted, by the noblest,
Richest, and cunningest masters in that Art,
And yet hath ever held a fair repute;
Could in one morning, and by him be brought,
To forget all her virtue, and turn whore?
I would I had some other talk in hand,
Then to accuse a sister to her brother;
Nor doe I mean it for a public scandal,
Unless by urging me, you make it so.
I will read this at better leisure: Gondarino, where is the Lady?
At his house.
No, she is departed thence.
Whither?
Urge it not thus, or let me be excused,
If what I speak betray her chastity,
And both increase my sorrow, and your own.
Fear me not so, if she deserve the fame
Which she hath gotten, I would have it published,
Brand her my self, and whip her through the city:
I wish those of my blood that doe offend,
Should be more strictly punished, then my foes.
Let it be proved.
Gondarino, thou shalt prove it, or suffer worse then she should doe.
Then pardon me, if I betray the faults
Of one, I love more dearly then my self,
Since opening hers, I shall betray mine own:
But I will bring you, where she now intends
Not to be virtuous: pride and wantonness,
That are true friends indeed, though no in show,
Have entered on her heart, there she doth bath,
And sleek her hair, and practise cunning looks,
To entertain me with; and hath her thoughts
As full of lust, as ever you did think
Them full of modesty.
Gondarino, lead on, we'll follow thee.
Here hope I to meet my citizen, and here hopes he to meet his scholar; I am sure I am grave enough, to his eyes, and knave enough to deceive him: I am believed to conjure, raise storms, and devils, by whose power I can doe wonders; let him believe so still, belief hurts no man: I have an honest black cloak, for my knave∣rye, and a General pardon for his foolery, from this present day, till the day of his Breaking. First not a mise∣rye, and the greatest of our age, to see a handsome, young, fair enough, and well mounted wench, humble her self, in an old stammel petticoat, standing possessed of no more fringe then the street can allow her: her upper parts so poor and wanting, that ye may see her bones through her bodies: shoes she would have, if her captain were come over, and is content the while to devote her self to antiēt slippers. These premises well cōsidered, gentlemē will move, they make me melt I promise ye, they stir me much; and were it not for my smooth, soft, silken City∣zen, I would quit this transitory trade, get me an euerla∣sting robe, fear up my conscience, and turn Sergeant. But here a comes, is mine as good as prize: Sir Pandarus be my speed, ye are most fitly met sir.
And you as well encountered, what of this heir?
hath your books been propitious?
Sir, it is done, shees come, she is in my house, make your self apt for Courtship, stroke up your stockings, loose not an inch of your legs goodness; I am sure ye wear sockes.
There your books fail ye Sir, in truth I wear no sockes.
I would ye had Sir, it were the sweeter grace for your legs; get on your gloves, are they perfumed?
A pretty wash Isle assure you.
Twill serve: your offers must be full of bounty, veluets to furnish a gown, silks for petticoats and fore∣parts, shag for linings; forget not some pretty jewel to fa∣sten, after some little complement: if she deny this curt∣sie, double your bounties, be not wanting in abundance, fullness of gifts, linked with a pleasing tongue, will win an Anchorite. Sir, ye are my friend, and friend to all that professes good letters; I must not use this office else, it fits not for a scholar, and a gentleman: those stoc∣kings are of Naples, they are silk?
Ye are again beside your text; sir, they are a the best of wool, and they cleeped jersey.
Sure they are very dear?
Nine shillings, by my love to learning.
Pardon my judgment, wee scholars use no other objects, but their books.
There is one thing entombed in that grave breast, that makes me equally admire it with your scholarship.
Sir, but that in modesty I am bound not to affect mine own commendation, I would inquire it of you?
Sure you are very honest, and yet ye have a kind of modest fear to show it: doe not deny it, that face of yours, is a worthy learned modest face.
Sir, I can blush.
Virtue and Grace are always paird together: but I will leave to stir your blood Sir, and now to our business.
Forget not my instructions.
I apprehend ye Sir, I will gather my self together, with my best phrases, and so I shall discourse in some sort takingly.
This was well worded Sir, and like a Scholar.
The Muses favour me as my intents are virtuous; Sir ye shall be my tutor, tic never to late Sir to love lear∣ning: when I can once speak true latin —
What do you intend Sir?
Marry I will then beggar all your Bawdy writers, and undertake at the peril of my own invention, all Pageants, poesies for Chimneys, Speeches for the Dukes entertainment, whenever and whatsoever; nay I will build at mine own charge, an Hospital, to which shall retyer, all diseased opinions, all broken Poets, all Prose-men that are fallen from small sense, to mere let∣ters; and it shall be lawful, for a Lawyer, if he bee a civil man, though a have undone others &amp; himself by the lan∣gauge; to retire to this poor life, and learn to be honest.
Sir ye are very good, and very charitable: ye are a true pattern for the City Sir.
Sir, I do know sufficiently their shop-bookes can∣not save them, there is a further end—
Oh: Sir much may be done by manescript.
I do confess it Sir, provided still they be canoni∣coll, and have some worthy hands set to um for probate∣on: but we forget our selves.
Sir enter when you please, and all good language tip your tongue.
All that love learning pray for my good success.
Boy, where abouts are we?
Sir by all tokens this is the house, bawdy I am sure by the broken windows, the fish head is within, if ye dare
venture, here you may surprise it.
The misery of man may fitly bee compared to a Didapper, who when she is under water past our sight, and indeed can seem no more to vs, rises again, shakes but her self, and is the same she was; so is it still with trance∣sitorie man, this day: oh but an hour since, &amp; I was mighty, mighty in knowledge, mighty in my hopes, migh∣tie in blessed means, and was so truly happy, that I durst a said, live Lazarello, and be satisfied: but now—
Sir ye are yet a flote and may recover, be not your own wrack, here lies the harbour, go in and ride at ease.
Boy I am received to be a Gentleman, a Court∣er, and a man of Action, modest, and wise, and bee it spo∣ken with thy reverence Child, abounding vertous; and would thou have a man of these choice habits, covet the cover of a bawdy house? yet if I go not in, I am but—
But what Sir?
Dust boy, but dust, and my soul unsatisfied shall haunt the keepers of my blessed Saint, and I will appear.
An Ass to all men; Sir these are no means, to stay your appetite, you must resolve to enter.
Were not the house subject to Martial law—
If that be all, Sir ye may enter, for ye can know no∣thing here, that the Court is ignorant of, only the more eyes shall look upon ye, for there they wink one at a∣nothers faults.
If I doe not,
Then ye must beat fairly back again, fall to your physical mess of porridge, &amp; the twice sacked cares of a Capon, Fortune may favour you so much, to send the bread to it: but its a mere venture, and money may bee put out upon it.
I will go in and live; pretend some love to the gentlewoman, screw my self in affectiō, &amp; so be satisfied.
This fly is caught, is masht already, I will suck him, and lay him by.
Muffle your self in your cloak by any means, it is a received thing among gallants, to walk to their lea∣cherie, as though they had the rheum, it was well you brought not your horse.
Why boy?
Faith Sir tic the fashion of our gentry, to have their horses wait at door like men, while the beasts their my∣sters, are within at rack &amp; mainger, it would have disco∣uered much.
I will lay by these habits, forms, and grave res∣pects of what I am, and bee my self; only my appetite, my fire, my soul, my being, my dear appetite shall go along with me, armed with whose strength, I fear les will attempt the greatest danger dare oppose my fury: I am resolved where ever that thou art, most sacred dish, hid from vnhollowed eyes, to find thee out.
Be thou in hell, raped by Proserpina,
To be a Rival in black Plutoes love:
Or moves thou in the heavens, a form divine:
Lashing the lazy Spheres:
Or if thou be returned to thy first being,
Thy mother Sea, there will I seek thee forth,
Earth, Ayre, nor Fire,
Nor the black shades below, shall bar my sight,
So daring is my powerful appetite.
Sir, you may save this long voyage, and take a shorter cut, you have forgot your self, the fish head's here, your own imaginations have made you mad.
Term it a jealous few•ie good my boy.
Faith Sir term it what you will, you must use o∣there terms ere you can get it.
The looks of my sweet love are fair, Fresh and feeding as the Ayre.
Sir, you forget your self.
Was never seen so rare a head, Of any Fish alive or dead.
Good Sir remember, this is the house Sir.
Cursed be he that dare not venture.
Pity your self sir, and leave this fury.
For such a prize, and so I enter.
Dun's in the mire, get out again how a can: My honest gallant, Isle show you one trick more Then ere the fool your father dreamd of yet. Madonna Iulia?
What news my sweet rogue, my dear sins broker, what? good news?
There is a kind of ignorant thing, much like a Courtier, now gone in.
Is a gallant?
A shines not very gloriously, nor does a wear one skin perfumed to keep the tother sweet; his coat is not in or, nor does the world run yet on wheels with him; is rich enough, and has a small thing follows him, like to a boat tied to a tall ships tail: give him entertain∣meant, be light and flashing like a Meteor, hug him about the neck, give him a kiss, and lisping cry, good Sir; and is thine own, as fast as a were tied to thine arms, by In∣dentures.
I dare doe more then this, if a bee a the true Court cut; Isle take him out a lesson worth the learning: but wee are but their Apes; whats he worth?
Be he rich, or poor, if he will take thee with him, thou moist use thy trade free from Constables, and Mar∣shells: who hath bin here since I went out?
There is a gentlewoman sent hither by a Lord, shoe's a piece of dainty stuff my rogue, smooth, and soft, as new Satin; she was never gumb'd yet boy, nor fret∣ted.
Where lies she?
She lies aboue, towards the street, not to be spoke with, but by the Lord that sent her, or some from him, we have in charge from his servants.
Peace, a comes out again upon discovery; up with all your canvas, hale him in; and when thou hast done, clap him a board bravely, my valiant Pinnace.
Be gone, I shall doe reason with him.
Are you the special beauty of this house?
Sir, you have given it a more special regard by your good language, then these black brows can merit.
Lady you are fair.
Fair sir? I thank ye; all the poor means I have left to be thought grateful, is but a kiss, and ye shall have it Sir.
Ye have a very mooing lip.
Prove it again Sir, it may bee your sense was set too high, &amp; so over wrought it self.
It is still the same: how far may ye hold the time to be spent Lady?
Four a clock sir.
I have not eat to day.
You will have the better stomach to your supper; in the mean time, Isle feed ye with delight.
It is not so good upon am empty stomach: if it might be without the trouble of your house, I would eat?
Sir, we can have a Capon ready.
The day?
It is Friday Sir.
I doe eat little flesh upon these days.
Come sweet, ye shall not think on meat; Isle drow• it with a better appetite.
I feel it work more strangely, I must eat.
It is now too late to send; I say ye shall not think on meat: if ye doe, by this kiss Isle be angry.
I could be far more sprightful, had I eaten, and more lasting.
What will ye have Sir? name but the Fish, my maid shall bring it, if it may be got.
Me thinks your house should not be so vnfurnisht, as not to have some pretty modicum?
It is so now: but could ye stay till supper?
Sure I have offended highly and much, and my in∣flictions make it manifest, I will retire henceforth, and keep my chamber, live privately, and die forgotten.
Sir I must crave your pardō, I had forgot my self; I have a dish of meat within, &amp; it is fish, I think this Duke∣dome holds not a daintier: it is an Vmbranoes head.
Lady, this kiss is yours, and this.
Hoe? within there? cover the board, and set the fish head on it.
Now am I so truly happy, so much aboue all fate and fortune, that I should despise that man, durst say, Re∣member Laz•rello, thou art mortal.
This is the villain, lay hands on him.
Gentlemen, why am I thus entreated? what is the nature of my crime?
Sir, though you have carried it a great while pri∣uatly, and (as you think) well; yet we have seen your Sir, and we doe know thee Lazarello, for a traitor.
The gods defend our Duke.
Amen. Sir, Sir, this cannot save that stiff neck from the halter.
Gentlemen, I am glad you have discovered him, a should not have eaten under my roof for twenty poūds; and surely I did not like him, when a called for Fish.
My friends, will ye let me have that little favour—
Sir, ye shall have law, and nothing else.
To let me stay the eating of a bit or two, for I pro∣test I am yet fasting?
Isle have no traitor come within my house.
Now could I wish my self, I had been Traitor, I have strength enough for to endure it, had I but patience: Man thou art but grass, thou art a bubble, and thou must perish.
Then lead along, I am prepared for all.
Since I have lost my hopes, welcome my fall.
Away sir.
As thou hast hope of man, stay but this dish this two hours, I doubt not but I shall be discharged: by this light I will marry thee.
You shall marry me first then?
I doe contract my self unto thee now, before these gentlemen.
Isle preserve it till you be hanged, or quited.
Thanks, thanks.
Away, away, you shall thank her at the gallows.
Adieu, adieu.
If he live, Isle have him; if he be hanged, there's no loss in it.
Hast thou provided one to bear my letter to my brother?
I have enquired, but they of the house will suffer no letter nor message to bee carried from you, but such as the Lord Gondarino shall bee acquainted with: Truly Ma∣dam, I suspect the house to be no better then it should be.
What doest thou doubt?
Faith, I am loath to tell it Madam.
Out with it, it is not true modesty to fear to speak that thou doest think.
I think it be one of these same bawdy houses.
It is no matter wench, wee are warm in it; keep thou thy mind pure, and upon my word, that name will doe thee no hurt: I cannot force my self yet to fear any thing; when I do get out, Isle have another encounter with my Woman Hater. Here will I sit, I may get sight of some of my friends, it must needs be a comfort to them to see me here.
Are wee all sufficiently disguised? for this house where she attends me, is not to bee visited in our own shapes.
We are not our selves.
I know the house to be sinful enough, yet I have bin heretofore, and durst now, but for discovering of you, appear here in my own likeness.
Whore's Lucio?
My Lord, he said, the affairs of the Common∣wealth, would not suffer him to attend always.
Some great ones questionless that hee will han∣dl.
Come, let vs enter?
See how Fortune strives, to revenge my quarrel upon these women, shoe's in the window, were it not to undo her, I should not look upon her.
Lead vs. Gondarino.
Stay, since you force me to display my shame,
Look there, and you my Lord, know you that face?
It is she?
It is.
It is she, whose greatest virtue ever was
Dissimulation, she that still hath strove
More to sin cunningly then to avoid it:
She that hath ever sought to be accounted
Most virtuous, when she did deserve most scandal:
It is she that itches now, and in the height
Of her intemperate thoughts, with greedy eyes
Expects my coming to allay her lust:
Leave her, forget shoe's thy sister.
Stay, stay.
I am as full of this, as thou can be,
The memory of this will easily
Hereafter stay my loose and wandering thoughts
From any woman.
This will not down with me, I dare not trust this fellow.
Leave her here, that only shall be her punish∣meant, never to be fetched from hence; but let her use her trade to get her living.
Stay, good my Lord, I do believe all this, as great men as I have had known whores to their sisters, &amp; have laughed at it, I would fine hear how she talks, since she grew thus light: will your grace make him show himself to her, as if hee were now come to satisfy her longing? whilst we unseen of her, ouer-heare her wantonness, let's make our best of it now we shall have good mirth.
Doe it Gondarino.
I must; fortune assist me but this once.
Here we shall stand unseen, and near enough.
Madame, Oriana.
Whose that? O! my Lord?
Shall I come up?
O you are merry, shall I come down?
It is better there.
What is the confession of the lye you made to the Duke, which I scarce believe yet you had impudence y∣nough to do? did not gain you so much faith with me, as that I was willing to be at your Lo. bestowing, till you had recovered my credit, and confessed your self a liar, as you pretended to do? I confess I began to fear you, and desired to be out of your house, but your own followers forced me hither.
It is well suspected, dissemble still, for there are some may hear vs.
More tricks yet, my Lord? what house this is I know not, I only know my self, it were a great conquest if you could fasten a scandal upon me: 'fayth my Lord, give me leave to write to my brother?
Come down.
Come down.
If it please your grace there's a back door.
Come meet vs there then?
It seems you are acquainted with the house.
I have bin in it.
She saw you, and dissembled.
Sir, we shall know that better.
Bring me unto her, if I prove her not
To be a strumpet, let me be contemned
Of all her sex.
Now whilst the young Duke follows his delights,
We that do mean to practise in the State,
Must pick our times, and set our faces in,
And nod our heads, as it may prove most fit
For the maine good of the dear Commonwealth:
Whose within there?
My Lord?
Secretary, fetch the gown I use to read petitions in, and the standish I answer French Letters with, and call in the gentleman that attends:
Little know they that do not deal in State,
How many things there are to be observed,
Which seem but little; yet by one of vs
(Whose brains do wind about the Commonwealth)
Neglected, cracks our credits utterly.
Sir, but that I do presume upon your secrecy,
I would not have appeared to you thus ignorantly attired without a tooth-picke in a ribbon, or a ring in my band∣strings.
Your Lordship sent for me?
I did: Sir your long practise in the state under a great man hath led you to much experience.
My Lord.
Suffer not your modesty to excuse it, in short and in private I desire your direction, I take my study already to be furnished after a grave and wise method.
What will this Lord do?
My book-strings are suitable &amp; of a reaching colour.
How's this?
My Standish of Wood strange and sweet, and my fore-flap hangs in the right place, and as near Machiauels, as can be gathered by tradition.
Are there such men as will say nothing abroad. and play the fools in their lodgings? this Lord must be followed: and hath your Lordship some new made words to scatter in your speeches in public, to gain note, that the hearers may carry them away, and dispute of them at dinner?
I have Sir: and besides my several gowns and caps agreeable to my several occasions.
It is well, and you have learned to write a bad hand, that the Readers may take pains for it.
Yes sir: and I give out I have the palsy.
Good, it were better though, if you had it, your Lo. hath a Secretary, that can write fair, when you purpose to be understood.
Faith sir I have one, there he stands, he hath bin my secretary this 7. years, but he hath forgotten to write.
If he can make a writing face, it is not amiss, so he keep his own counsel: your Lo. hath no hope of the gout?
Vh, little sir, since the pain in my right foot left me.
Twill be some scandal to your wisdom, though I see your Lo. knows enough in public business.
I am not employed (though to my desert) in occa∣zion foreign, nor frequented for matters domestic.
Not frequented? what course takes your Lordship?
The readiest way, my door stands wide, my Secre∣tarry knows I am not denied to any.
In this (give me leave) your Lordship is out of the way: make a back door to let out Intelligencers; seem to be ever busy, and put your door under keepers, and you shall have a troop of clients sweating to come at you.
I have a backdoor already, I will henceforth be bu∣sie, secretary run and keep the door.
This will fetch am?
I hope so.
My Lord, there are some require access to you a∣bout weighty affairs of state.
All ready.
I told you so.
How weighty is the business.
Treason my Lord.
Sir, my debts to you for this are great.
I will leave your Lordship now.
Sir my death must be sudden, if I requite you not; at the back door good Sir.
I will be your Lordships intelligencer for once.
My Lord.
Let'am in, and say I am at my study.
Where is your Lord?
At his study, but he will have you brought in.
Why Gentlemen, what will you charge me withal?
Treason, horrible treason, I hope to have the leading of thee to prison, and prick thee on 'ith arse with a halberd: to have him heng'd that salutes thee, and call all those in question, that spit not upon thee.
My thread is spun, yet might I but call for this dish of meat at the gallous, in stead of a Psalm, it were to be endured: the Curtain opens, now my end draws on.
Gentlemen I am not empty of weighty occasi∣once at this time; I pray you your business.
My Lord, I think wee have discovered one of the most blodie Traitors, that ever the world held.
Signior Lazarillo, I am glad ye'are one of this disco∣very, give me your hand.
My Lord that is the Traitor.
Keep him off, I would not for my whole estate have touched him.
My Lord.
Peace Sir, I know the devil is at your tongues end, to furnish you with speeches? what are the particulars?
you charge him with.
We have conferred our notes, &amp; have extracted that, which we will justify upon our oaths.
That he would bee greater then the Duke, that he had cast plots for this, and meant to corrupt some to betray him, that he would burn the City, kill the Duke, and poison the privy Council; and lastly kill himself. Though thou deserve justly to bee hanged, with silence yet I allow thee to speak, be short.
My Lord, so many my greatest wish succeed,
So may I live, and compass what I seek,
As I had never treason in my thoughts,
Nor ever did conspire the overthrow
Of any creatures, but of brutish beasts,
Fowls, Fishes, and such other human food
As is provided for the good of man,
If stealing Custards, Tarts, and Florentines
By some late Statute be created treason;
How many fellow Courtiers can I bring,
Whose long attendance, and experience,
Hath made them deeper in the plot then I.
Peace, such hath ever been the clemency of my gracious moister the Duke, in all his proceedings, that I had thought, and thought I had thought rightly; that malice would long ere this, have hid her self in her den, and have turned her own sting against her own heart: but I well now perceive; that so forward is the deposit∣on of a depraved nature; that it doth not only seek re∣avenge, where it hath received injuries; but many times thirst after their destruction, where it hath met with been∣fits.
But my good Lord—
Lets gag him.
Peace again, but many times thirst after distructi∣on, where it hath met with benefits; there I left: Such, &amp; no better are the business, that we have now in hand.
Hoe's excellently spoken.
He will wind a Tratour I warrant him.
But surely me thinks, setting aside the touch of Conscience, and all other inward convulsions.
He will be hanged, I know by that word.
Your Lordship may consider—
Hold thy peace: thou can not answer this speech: no Tratour can answer it: but because you can∣not answer this speech; I take it you have confessed the Treason.
The Count Valour was the first that discovered him, and can witness it, but hee left the matter to your Lordships grave consideration.
I thank his Lordship, carry him away speedily to the Duke.
Now Lazarillo thou are tumbled down
The hill of Fortune, with a violent arm;
All plagues that can be, Famine, and the sword
Will light upon thee, black despair will boyle
In thy despairing breast, no comfort by,
Thy Friends far off, thy enemies are no.
Away with him, Isle follow you, look you pine∣on him, and take his money from hurt, least he swallow a shilling and kill himself.
Get then on before.
Now Gondarino, what can you put on now
That may again deceive vs,
Have ye more strange illusions, yet more mists,
Through which the weak eye may beled to error:
What can ye say that may doe satisfaction
Both for her wronged honour, and your ill?
All I can say or may is said already,
She is unchaste, or else I have no knowledge,
I doe not breath, nor have the use of sense.
Dare ye be yet so wilful, ignorant,
Of your own nakedness, did not your servants
In mine own hearing confess
They brought her to that house, we found her in;
Almost by force: and with a great distrust
Of some ensuing hazard.
He that hath begun so worthily,
It fits not with his resolution
To leave of thus: my Lord I know these are but idle proves.
What says your Lordship to them?
Count, I dare yet pronounce again, thy Sister is not honest.
You are your self my Lord, I like your setel'dnes.
Count thou art young, and unexperienced, in the dark hidden ways of women. Thou dare affirm with confidence a Lady of fifteen may be a maid.
Sir if it were not so, I have a Sister would set near my heart.
Let her sit near her shame, it better fits her: call back the blood that made our stream in nearness, and turn the Currant to a better use, it is too much mud∣ded, I doe grieve to know it.
Dare thou make up again, dare to turn face, knowing wee know thee, hast thou not been discovered openly: did not our ears hear her deny thy courtings? did we not see her blush with modest anger, to be so over∣taken by a trick; can ye deny this Lord?
Had not your Grace, and her kind brother
Been within level of her eye,
You should have had a hotter volley from her
More full of blood and fire, ready to leap the window, where she stood.
So truly sensual is her appetite,
Sir, Sir, these are but words and tricks, give me the proof.
What need a better proof then your Lordship, I am sure ye have lain with her my Lord.
I have confessed it Sir.
I dare not give thee credit without witness.
Doe's your Grace think, wee carry seconds, with vs, to search vs, and see fair play: your Grace hath been ill tutored in the business; but if you hope to try her truly, and satisfy your self what frailty is, give he the Test: doe not remember Count she is your Sister; nor let my Lord the Duke believe she is fair; but put her too'it without hope or pity, then ye shall see that golden form fly off, that all eyes wonder at for pure and fixed, and under it, base blushing copper; met∣tall not worth the meanest honour: you shall behold her then my Lord Transparent, look through her heart, and view the spirits how they leap, and tell me then, I did belie the Lady.
It shall be done: come Gondarino bear vs company,
We doe believe thee she shall die, and thou shalt see it.
How now my friends, whom have ye guarded hither.
So please your Grace wee have discovered a a villain and a Traitor: the Lord Lucio hath examined him, and sent him to your Grace for Judgment.
My Lord, I dare absoule him from all sin of Treason: I know his most ambitions is but a dish of meat; which a'hath hunted, with so true a sent, that hee deserves the Collar, not the Halter.
Why do they bring him thus boūd up? the poor man had more need of some warm meat, to comfort his cold stomach.
Your grace shall have the cause hereafter, when when you may laugh more freely. But these are called Informers: men that live by Treason; as Rat-chatchers do by poison.
•••lt there were no heavier prodigies hung over vs, then this poor fellow, I durst redeem all perils ready to power thēselues upon this state, with a cold Custard.
Your grace might do it, without dāger toy our persō.
My Lord, if ever I intended Treason against your person, or the state, unless it were by wishing from your Table, some dish of meat; which I must needs con∣fesse, was not a subjects part: or coveting by stealth, supp• from those noble bottles, that no mouth keeping allege∣ance true, should dare to taste: I must confess with more then covetous eyes, I have bee held those dear concealed dishes, that have been brought in, by cunning equipage, to waite upon your graces palate: I do confess out of this present heat, I have had stratagems, &amp; ambuscadoes: but God be thanked they have never took.
Count, this business is your own; when you have done, repair to vs.
I will attend your grace: Lazarello, you are at li∣bertie, be your own man again; and if ye can be moister of your wishes, I wish it may be so.
I humbly thank your Lordship: I must bee un∣mannerly, I have some present business, once more I hearti∣lie thank your Lordship.
Now even a word or two to you, and so farewell; you think you have deserved much of this state, by this dis∣couerie: y' are a slavish people, grown subject to the com∣mon course of all men. How much unhappy were that noble spirit, could work by such baser gains? what mi∣sery would not a knowing man put on, with willingness, ere he see him self grown fat and full fed, by fall of those you rise by? I do discharge ye my attendance; our health∣full state needs no such Leeches to suck out her blood.
I do beseech your Lordship.
Good my L.
Go learn to be more honest, whē I see you work your means from honest industry,
I will be willing to accept your labours:
Till then I will keep back my promised favours:
Here comes an other remnant of folly:
I must dispatch him too. Now Lord Lucio, what business bring you hither?
Faith Sir, I am discovering what will become of that notable piece of Treason, intended by that varlet La∣zarello; I have sent him to the Duke for judgment.
Sir you have performed the part of a most care∣full states-man, and let me say it to your face, Sir of a Fa∣there to this state: I would wish you to retire, and ensconce your self in study: for such is your daily labour, and our fear, that the loss of an hour may breed our overthrow.
Sir I will be cōmaunded by your judgement, and though I find it a trouble scant to be waded through, by these weak years, yet for the dear care of the Com∣mon-wealth, I will bruise my brains, and cōfine my self to much vexation.
Go, and may thou knock down Treason like an Ox.
Amen.
Have I spoke thus much in the honour of learning? learned the names of the seuē liberal Sciences, before my marriage; &amp; since, have in hast written Epistles congratula∣rye, to the •9. Muses: &amp; is she proved a whore &amp; a Beggar?
Tic true, you are not now to be taught, that no man can be learned of a sudden; let not your first project dis∣courage you, what you have lost in this, you may get again in Alcumie.
Fear not husband, I hope to make as good a wife, as the best of your neighbours have, and as honest.
I will go home; good sir do not publish this, as lōg as it run's amōgst our selves; it is good honest mirth: you'll come hōe to supper; I mean to have al her friends &amp; mine as ill as it goes. 
Do wisely sir, &amp; bid your own friēds, your whole wealth will scarce feast all hers, neither is it for your cadet, to walk the streets, with a woman so noted, get you home, and provide her clothes: let her come an hour hēce with an hād-basket &amp; shift her self, she'll serve to sit at the upper end of the Table, &amp; drink to your customers.
Art is just, and will make me a mends.
No doubt Sir.
The chief note of a Scholar you say, is to go∣uerne his passions; wherefore I do take all patiently; in sign of which my most dear wife, I do kiss thee: make hast home after me, I shall be in my Study.
Go, a vaunt, my new City dame, send me what you promised me for consideration; and may thou prove a Lady.
Thou shalt have it, his silks shall fly foe• it.
How sweets a calm after a tempest, what is there now that can stand betwixt me and felicity? I have gon through all my crosses constātly; have confoūd∣ed my enemies, and know where to have my longings sa∣tisfied; I have my way before me, there is the door, and I may freely walk into my delights. knock Boy.
Who's their?
Madonna my love, not guilty, not guilty, open the door.
Art thou come sweet heart?
Yes to thy soft embraces, and the rest of my over∣flowing blisses; come let vs in and swim in our delights: a short grace as we go, and so to meat.
Nay my dear love, you must bear with me in this; we will to the Church first.
Shall I be sure of it then.
By my love you shall.
I am content, for I do now wish to hold off long∣er, to whet my appetite, and doe desire to meet with more troubles, so I might conquer them.
And as a holy lover that hath spent
The tedious night, with many asigh and tears;
Whilst he pursued his wench: and hath observed
The smiles, and frowns, not daring to displease;
When at last, hath with his service won
Her yielding heart; that she begins to dote
Upon him, and can hold not longer out,
But hangs about his neck, and woes him more
Then ever he desired her love before:
Then begins to flatter his desert,
And growing wanton, needs will cast her off;
Try her, pick quarrels, to breed fresh delight,
And to increase his pleasing appetite.
Come Mouse, will you walk?
I pray thee let me bee delivered of the joy I am so big with; I doe feel that high heat within me, that I begin to doubt whether I be mortal?
How I contemn my fellows in the Court,
With whom I did but yesterday converse,
And in a lower and an humbler key
Did walk, and meditate on grosser meates:
There are they still poor rogues, shaking their chops,
And sneaking after cheeses, and doe run
Headlong in chase of every jacke of Beer
That crosses them, in hope of some repast,
That it will bring them to; whilst I am here,
The happiest wight, that ever set his tooth
To a dear novelty: approach my love,
Come let's go to knit the true loves knot,
That never can be broken.
That is to marry a whore.
When that is done, then will we taste the gift,
Which Fates have sent, my fortunes up to lift.
When that is done, you'll begin to repent, upon a full stomach; but I see, it is but a form in destiny, not to be altered.
Sir, what may be the currant of your business, that thus you single out your time and place?
Madame, the business now imposed upon me, concerns you nearly; I wish some worser man might finish it.
Why are ye changed so? are ye not well sir?
Yes madam, I am well, wo'd you were so.
Why sir? I feel my self in perfect health.
And yet ye cannot live long, madam.
Why good Arrigo?
Why, ye must die.
I know I must, but yet my fate calls not upon me.
It does; this hand the Duke commands shall give you death.
Heaven, and the powers divine, guard well the innocent.
Lady, your prayers may doe your soul some good,
That sure your body cannot merit by'vm:
You must prepare to die.
What's my offence? what have these years com∣meted,
That may be dangerous to the Duke or State?
Have I conspired by poison? have I given up
My honour to some loose unsettled blood
That may give action to my plots?
Dear sir, let me not die ignorant of my faults?
Ye shall not.
Then Lady, you must know, you are held dishonest;
The Duke, your brother, and your friends in court,
With too much grief condemn ye: though to me,
The fault deserves not to be paid with death.
Who is my accuser?
Lord Gondarino.
Arrigo, take these words, and bear them to the Duke,
It is the last petition I shall ask thee:
Tell him the child, this present hour brought forth
To see the world, he's not a soul more pure, more white,
More virgin then I have. Tell him Lord Gondarinoes
Plot, I suffer for, and willingly: tel him it had bin a greater
honour, to have saved then killed: but I have done: strike,
I am armed for heaven. Why stay you? is there any hope?
I would not strike.
Have you the power to save?
With hazard of my life, if it should be known?
You will not venture that?
I will: Lady, there is that means yet to escape your death, if you can wisely apprehend it.
Ye dare not be so kind?
I dare, and will, if you dare but deserve it.
If I should slight my life, I were too blame.
Then madam, this is the means, or else you die: I love you.
I shall believe it, if you save my life.
And you must lie with me.
I dare not buy my life so.
Come ye must resolve, say yea or no.
Then no; nay look not ruggedly upon me,
I am made up too strong, to fear such looks.
Come, doe your Butchers part: before I would win life,
with the dear loss of honour, I dare find means to free my self.
Speak, will ye yield?
Villain, I will not; murderer doe thy worst, thy base unnoble thoughts dare prompt thee to; I am aboue thee slave.
Will thou not be drawn to yield by fair pursue∣sions?
No nor by—
Peace, know your doom then; your Ladyship must remēber, you are not now at home, where you dare jest at all that come about you: but you are fallen under my mercy, which shall be small: if thou refuse to yield, hear what I have sworn unto my self; I will enjoy thee, though it between the parting of thy soul and body. Yield yet and live.
Isle guard the one, let heavens guard the tother.
Are ye so resolute then? Duk. frō aboue. Hold, hold, I say.
What have I? yet more terror to my tragedy?
Lady, the scene of blood is done; ye are now as free from scandal, as from death.
Thou woman which were borne to teach vert••
Fair, sweet, and modest maid forgive my thoughts,
My trespass was my love. Seize Gondarino, let him 〈◊〉 dooms.
I doe begin in a little to love this woman; I could in∣dure her already twelve miles off.
Sister, I am glad you have brought your honour off so fairly, without loss: you have done a work aboue your sex, the Duke admires it; give him fair encounter.
Best of all comforts; may I take this hand, and call it mine?
I am your Graces handmaid.
Would ye had sed my self: might it not be so Lady?
Sister, say I: I know ye can afford it.
My Lord, I am your subject, you may command me, provided still, your thoughts be fair and good.
Here, I am yours; and when I cease to be so,
Let heaven forget me: thus I make it good.
My Lord, I am no more mine own.
So: this bargain was well driven.
Duke, thou hast sold away thy self to all pard∣tion; thou art this present hour becoming cuckold: me thinks I see thy gaul grate through thy veins, and jea∣lousy seize thee with her talents: I know that women's nose must be cut off, she cannot scope it.
Sir, we have punishment for you.
I doe beseech your Lordship, for the wrongs this mā¦hath done me, let me pronounce his punishment.
Lady, I give to you, he is your own.
I doe beseech your grace, let me be banished with al the speed that may be.
Stay still, you shall attend her sentence.
Lord Gondarino, you have wronged me highly, yet since it sprung from no peculiar hate to me, but from a general dislike unto all women, you shall thus suffer for it; Arrigo, call in some Ladies to assist vs: will your Grace take your State?
My Lord I doe beseech your Grace for any pu∣nishment saving this woman, let me bee sent upon disco∣very of some Island, I doe desire but a small Gundele, with ten Holland Cheeses, and isle undertake it.
Sir ye must bee content, will ye sit down? nay doe it willingly. Arrigo tie his arms close to the chair, I dare not trust his patience.
Mai'st thou be quickly old and painted; mai'st thou dote upon some sturdy Yeoman of the wood-yarde, and he be honest; mai'st thou be bared the lawful lechery of thy Coach for want of Instruments; and last, bee thy womb vnopen'd.
This fellow hath a pretty gaul.
My Lord, I hope to see him purged ere a part.
Your Ladyships are welcome: I must desire your helps, though you are no Physicians, to doe a strange cure upon this Gentleman.
In what we can assist ye Madam, ye may com∣maund vs.
Now do I fit like a Conjurer within my circle, and these the Devils that are raised about me, I will pray that they may have no power upon me.
Ladies fall off in couples, then with a soft still march with low demeanours, charge this Gentleman: isle be your leader.
Let me be quartered Duke quickly, I can endure it: these women, long for mans flesh, let them have it.
Count, have you ever seen so strange a passion? what would this fellow doe, if a should find himself in bed with a young Lady?
Faith my Lord, if a could get a knife, sure a wo'd cut her throat, or else a wo'd doe as Hercules did by Lies, swing out her soul: has the true hate of a womā in him.
Low with your curseyes Ladies.
Come not too near me, I have a breath will poi∣son ye, my lungs are rotten, and my stomach raw; I
am given much to belching: hold off, as you love sweet aires; Ladies by your first nights pleasure, I conjure you, as you wo'd have your husbands proper men, strong backs, and little legs, as you would have um hate your waiting women.
Sir we must court ye till wee have obtained some little favour from those gracious eyes, tic but a kiss a piece.
I pronounce perdition to ye all; ye are a parcel of that damned Crew, that fell down with Lucifer, and here ye stayed on earth, to plague poor men; vanish, a∣uaunt, I am fortified against your charms; heaven grant me breath and patience.
Shall we not kiss then?
No, fear my lips with hot irons first, or stitch them up like a Ferrets: O that this brunt were over.
Come, come, little rogue, thou art too maidenly by my troth, I think I must box thee, till thou be boulder; the more bold, the more welcome: I pre thee kiss me, be not afraid?
If there bee any here, that yet have so much of the fool left in them, as to love their Mothers, let them look on her, and loath them too.
What a slovenly little villain art thou, why dost thou not stroke up thy hair? I think thou ne'er comb'st it: I must have it lie in better order; so, so, so, let me see thy hands, are they washed?
I would they were loose for thy sake.
She tortures him admirably.
The best that ever was.
Alas how cold they are poor golls, why dost thee not get thee a musse?
Madam, her's an old Country gentlewoman at the door, that came nodding up for Justice, she was with the Lord Gondarino to day, and would now again come? to the speech of him; she says.
Let her in, for sports sake, let her in.
Mercy O Duke, I doe appeal to thee: plan•
Cannons there, and discharge them against my breast ra∣there: nay first, let this she fury sit still where she do's, and with her nimble fingers stroke my hair, play with my fingers ends, or anything, until my panting heart have broken my breast.
You must abide her censure.
I see her come, vnbutton me, for she will speak.
Where is hee Sir?
Save me, I hear her.
There he is in state, to give you audience.
How doe's your good Lordship?
Sick of the spleen.
How?
Sick.
Will you chew a Nutmeg, you shall not re∣fuse it, tic very comfortable.
Nay now thou art come, I know it is the Devils Jubilee, hell is broke loose:
My Lord, If ever I have done you service,
Or have deserved a favour of your Grace,
Let me be turned upon some present Action,
Where I may sooner die, then languish thus;
Your Grace hath her petition, grant it her, and ease me now at last.
No Sir, you must endure.
For my petition; I hope your Lordship hath remembered me.
Faith I begin to pity him, Arrigo take her off, bear her away; say her petition is granted.
Whether doe you draw me Sir? I know it is not my Lords pleasure I should be thus used, before my bu∣sins be dispatched?
You shall know more of that without.
Unbind him Ladies, but before he go, this hee shall promise; for the love I bear to our own sex, I would have them still hated by thee, and enjoin thee as a pu∣nishmēt,
never herafter willingly to come in the presence or fight of any woman, nor never to seek wrongfully the public disgrace of any.
Tic that I would have sworn, and doe: when I meddle with them, for their good, or their bad; may Time call back this day again, and when I come in their companies, may I catch the pox, by their breath, and have no other pleasure for it.
Ye are too merciful.
My Lord, I showed my sex the better.
All is ouer-blowne Sister, you're like to have a fair night of it, and a Prince in your arms: lets go my Lord.
Thus through the doubtful Streams of Joy and True love doth wade, and finds at last relief.
