Hail holy earth, whose cold arms do embrace
The truest man that ever fed his flocks:
By the fat plains of fruitful Thessaly,
Thus I salute thy grave, thus do I pay
My early vows and tribtute of mine eyes,
To thy still loved ashes: thus I free
My self from all ensuing heats and fires
Of love, all sports, delights and games,
That Shepherds hold full deers thus put I off.
Now no more shall these smooth brows be go•t,
With youthful coronals, and lead the dance,
No more the company of fresh fair Maids
And wanton shepherds be to me delightful.
Nor the shrill pleasing sound of merry pipes,
Under some shady dell• when the cool wind
Plays on the leaves, all be far away:
Since thou art far away: by whose dear side,
How often have I sat crowned with fresh flowers
For Summers queen, whilst every Shepherds boy•
Puts on his lustily greene with gaudy hook,
And hanging scrip o• finest cordeuan:
But thou art gone, and these are gone with thee,
And all are dead but thy dear memory:
That shall outlive thee, and shall ever spring,
Whilst there are pipes, or Jolly shepherds sing.
And here will I, in honour of thy love,
Dwell by thy grave, forgetting all those joys,
That former times made precious to mine eyes:
Only remembering what my youth did gain,
In the dark hidden virtuous use of herbs:
That I will I practise, and as freely give
All my endeavours, as I gained them free.
Of all greene wounds I know the remedies,
In men or cattle, be they stung with snakes,
Or charmed with powerful words of wicked art,
Or be they loue-sicke, or through too much heat
Grown wilde or lunatic, their eyes or ears
Thickened with misty film of dulling rum,
These I can cure, such secret virtue lies
In herbs applied by a virgins hand:
My meat shall be what these wilde woods afford,
Berries, and Chestnuts, Plantains, on whose cheeks
The Sun sits smiling, and the lofty fruit
P•lt from the fair head of the strait grown pine:
On these Isle feed with free content and rest,
When night shall blind the world, by thy side blessed.
Through yon same bending plain,
That flings his arms down to the maine,
And through these thick woods have I run,
whose boat•ome never• kissed the Sun
Since the lusty spring began,
All to please my M•ester Pan,
Have I trotted without rest
To get him fruit, for at a feast,
He entertains this coming night,
His Paramour the Syrinx bright:
But behold a fairer sight•
By that heavenly form of thine,
Brightest fair thou art divine:
Sp•ong from great immortal race
Of the G•ds: for in thy face,
Shines more awful majesty,
Then dull weak mortality
Dare with misty eyes behold
And live, therefore on this mould,
Lowly do I bend my knee,
In worship of thy deity,
Deign it Goddess from my hand,
To receive what ere this land,
From her fertile womb doth send
Of her choice fruits: and but lend,
Belief to that the Satire tells,
Fairer by the famous wells,
To this present day ne'er grew,
Never better nor more true,
Here be grapes whose lusty blood,
Is the learned Poets good,
Sweeter yet did never crown,
The head of Bacchus, nuts more browne
Then the squirrels teeth that crack them,
Deign ô fairest fair to take them,
For these black eyed Driope,
Hath often times commanded me,
With my clasped knee to clime,
See how well the lusty time,
Hath decked their rising cheeks in red,
Such as on your lips is spread,
Here be berries for a Queen,
Some be red, some be greene:
These are of that luscious meat,
The great God Pan, himself doth eat:
All these, and what the woods can yield,
The hanging mountain or the field,
I freely offer, and ere long,
Will bring you more, more sweet and strong.
Till when humbly leave I take,
Least the great Pan do awake:
That sleeping lies in a deep glade,
Vnde a broad beeches shade:
I must go, I must run,
Swifter then the fiery Sun.
And all my fears go with thee.
What greatness or what private hidden power,
Is there in me to draw submission,
From this rude man, and beast? sure I am mortal,
The daughter of a Shepherd, he was mortal:
And she that bore me mortal: prick my hand
And it will bleed: a fever shakes me,
And the selfsame wind that makes the yoūg lambs shrink,
Makes me a cold, my fear says I am mortal:
Yet I have heard (my mother told it me)
And now I doe believe it, if I keep
My virgin flower vncropt, pure, chaste, &amp; fair,
No Goblin, wood-god, Faiery, Elf, or Fiend,
Satyr or other power that haunts these groaues,
Shall hurt my body, or by vain illusion,
Draw me to wander after idle •iers.
Or voices calling me in dead of night,
To make me follow, and so told me on,
Through mires and standing pools:
Else why should this rough thing, who never knew
Manners, nor smooth humanity, whose heats
Are rougher then himself, and more misshapen,
Thus mildly kneel to me? sure there is a power
In that great name of virgin; that binds fast
All rude uncivil bloods, all appetites
That break their confines: then strong chastity,
Be thou my strongest guard, for here Il'e dwell
In opposition against Fate and Hell.
Now we have done this holy festival,
In honour of our great God, and his rights
Performed, prepare your selves for chaste
And uncorrupted fires: that as the priest,
With powerful hand shall sprinkle on your brows
His pure and holy water, ye may be
From all hot flames of lust, and loose thoughts free,
Kneel shepherds kneel, here comes the Priest of Pan.
Shepherds thus I purge away,
Whatsoever this great day,
Or the past hours gave not good,
To corrupt your maiden blood:
From the high rebellious heat,
Of the grapes and strength of meat.
From the wanton quick desires,
They do kindle by their fires.
I do wash you with this water,
Be you pure and fair hereafter.
From your livers and your veins,
Thus I take away the staines.
All your thoughts be smooth and fair,
Be ye fresh and free as ayre.
Never more let lustful heat,
Through your purged conduits beat,
Or a plighted troth be broken,
Or a wanton verse be spoken:
In a Shepherdesses ear,
Go your ways you're all clear.
Sing his praises that doth keep,
our Flocks from harm,
Pan the Father of our sheep,
And arm in arm
Tread we softly in a round,
Whilst the hollow neighbouring ground,
Fills the music with her sound,
Pan, o great God, Pan to thee
Thus do we sing:
Thou that keep vs chaste and free,
As the young spring,
Ever be thy honour spoke,
From that place the morn is broke,
To that place Day doth vnyoke.
Stay gentle Amoret thou fair browd maid,
Thy Shepherd prays thee stay, that holds thee de ere.
Equal with his souls good:
Speak, I give
Thee freedom Shepherd, &amp; thy tongue be still
The same it ever was: as free from ill
As he whose conversation never knew
The court or city: be thou ever true.
When I fall off from my affection,
Or mingle my clean thoughts with foul desires,
First let our great God cease to keep my flocks,
That being left alone without a guard,
The woolfe, or winters rage, summers great heat,
And want of water, to•s: or what to vs
Of ill is yet unknown, fall speedily,
And in their general ruin let me go.
I pray thee gentle Shepherd wish not so,
I do believe thee: tic as hard for me
To think thee false, and harder then for thee
To hold me foul.
ô you are fairer far,
Then the chaste blushing morn, or that fair star,
That guides the wandering seaman through the deep•
Straighter then the straightest pine upon the steep
Head of an aged mountain, and more white,
Then the new milk we strip before day light
From the full freighted bag• of our fair flocks:
Your hair more beauteous then those hanging lockes
Of young Apollo.
Shepherd be not lost,
Ye are sailed too far already from the coast
Of our discourse.
Did you not tell me once
I should not love alone, I should not loose
Those many passions, vows• and holy oaths,
I have sent to heaven: did you not give your hand,
Even that fair hand in hostage? do not then
Give back again those sweets to other men.
You your self vowed were mine,
Shepherd so far as maidens modesty
May give assurance, I am once more thine,
Once more I give my hand, be ever free
From that great foe to faith, foul jealousy.
I take it as my best good, and desire
For stronger confirmation of our love,
To meet this happy night in that fair grove,
Where all true shepherds have rewarded been
For their long service: say sweet shall it hold?
Dear friend you must not blame me if I make
A doubt of what the silent night may doe,
Coupled with this days heat to move your blood:
Maids must be fearful, sure you have not been
Washd white enough, for yet I see a stain
Stick in your liver, go and purge again.
O do not wrong my honest simple truth,
My self and my affections are as pure,
As those chaste flames that burn before the shrine•,
Of the great Dian: only my intent
To draw you thither, was to plight our trothes,
With interchange of mutual chaste embraces,
And ceremonious tying of our souls:
For to that holy wood is consecrate,
A virtuous Well, about whose flowery banks,
The nimble footed Faieries dance their rounds,
B• the pale mooneshine, dipping often times
Th•ir st•len children, so to make them free
From dying flesh, and dull mortality:
By this fair Fount hath many a Shepherd sworn,
And given away his freedom, many a troth
Been plight, which neither envy nor old time
Could ever break, with many a chaste kiss given,
In hope of coming happiness: by this
Fresh Foun•aine many a blushing maid
Hath crowned the head of her long loved shepherd,
With gaudy flowers, whilst he happy sung,
Lays of his love and dear captivity,
There grows all h•orbs fit to cool looser flames,
Our sensual parts pro•ok chiding our bloods,
And quenching by they• power those hidden sparks,
Th•t else would break out, and provoke our sense,
To open fires, so virtuous is that place:
Then gentle Shepherdess believe and grant,
In troth it 〈◊〉 not with that face to scant.
Your faithful Shepherd of those chaste desi•es,
He ever aimd at, and—
Thou hast prevailed, farewell, this coming night,
Shall crown thy chaste hopes with long wished delight.
Our great God Pan reward thee for that good,
Thou hast given thy poor shepherd fairest bud
Of maiden virtues: when I leave to be
The true admirer of thy chastity,
Let me des•rue the hot polluted name,
Of a wilde woodman, or affect some dame
Whose often prostitution hath begot,
More foul diseases, then ever yet the hot
Sun bred through his burnings, whilst the dog
Pursues the raging Lyon, throwing fog
And deadly vapor from his angry breath.
Filling the lower world with plague and death.
Shepherd may I desire to be believed,
What I shall blushing tell?
Fair maid you may.
Then softly thus, I love thee Perigot,
And would be gladder to be lewd again,
Then the cold earth is in his frozen arms
To •l•p the wanton spring: nay do not start,
Nor wonder that I woe thee! thou that art
The prime of our young grooms, even the top
Of all our lusty Shepherds: what dull eye
That n•for was acquainted with desire,
Hath s•en thee wrestle, run, or cast the stone,
Wi•h nimble strength and fair delivery,
And hath not sparckled fire, and speedily
Sent secret heat to all the neighbouring veins?
Who ever heard thee sing, that brought again,
That freedom back was lent unto thy voice?
Then do not blame me (shepherd) if I be
One to be numbered in this company,
Since none that ever saw thee yet, were free.
Fair Shepherdess much pity I can lend,
To your complaints: but sure I shall not love:
All that is mine, my self and my best hopes,
Are given already: do not love him then
That cannot love again: on other men
Bestow those heats more free, that may return
You fire for fire, and in one flame equal burn.
Shall I rewarded be so slenderly
For my affection, most unkind of men?
If I were old, or had agreed with Art,
To give another nature to my cheeks,
Or were I common mistress to the love
Of every swain, or could I with such ease
Call back my love, as many a wanton doth,
Thou might refuse me Shepherd, but to thee
I am only fixed and set, let it not be
A sport, thou gentle Shepherd, to abuse
The love of silly maid.
Fair soul, ye use
These words to little end: for know, I may
Better call back, that time was yesterday,
Or stay the coming night, then bring my love
Home to my self again, or recreant prove.
I will no longer hold you with delays,
This present night I have appointed been,
To meet that chaste fair (that enjoys my soul)
In yonder grove, there to make up our loves.
Be not deceived no longer, choose again,
These neighbouring plains have many a comely swain,
Fresher and freeer far then I ere was,
Bestow that love on them and let me pass,
Farewell, be happy in a better choice.
Cruel, thou hast struck me deader with thy voice
Then if the angry heavens with their quick flames,
Had shot me through: I must not leave to love,
I cannot, no I must enjoy thee boy,
Though the great dangers twixt my hopes and that
Be infinite: there is a Shepherd dwells
Down by the More, whose life hath ever shown
More fullen discontent then Saturnes brow,
When he sits frowning on the births of men:
One that doth wear himself away in lonenesse,
And never joys unless it be in breaking
The holy pl•ghted troths of mutual souls:
One that lusts after every several beauty,
But never yet was known to love or like,
Were the face fairer or more full of truth,
Then Phoebe in her fullness, or the youth
Of smooth Lyeus, whose ny starved flocks
Are always scabby, and infect all sheep
They feed withal, whose lambs are ever last,
And dye before their weaning, and whose dog,
Looks like his Moister, lean, and full of scurffe,
Not caring for the pipe or whistle: this man may
(If he be well wrought) do a deed of wonder,
Forcing me passage to my long desires:
And here he comes, as fitly to my purpose
As my quick thoughts could wish for.
Fresh beauty, let me not be thought uncivil,
Thus to be partner of your lonenesse: t'was
My love (that ever working passion) drew
Me to this place to seek some remedy
For my sick soul: be not unkind and fair,
For such, the mighty Cupped in his dombe
Hath sworn to be avenged on, then give room
To my consuming fires, that so I may
Enjoy my long desires, and so allay
Those flames, that else would burn my life away.
Shepherd, were I but sure thy heart were sound
As thy words seem to be, means might be found
To cure thee of thy long pains: for to me
That heavy youth consuming misery,
The love sick soul endures, never was pleasing,
I could be well content with the quick easing
Of thee &amp; thy hot fires, might it procure
Thy faith, and farther service to be sure.
Name but that great work, danger, or what can
Be compassed by the wit or art of man,
And if I fail in my performance, may
I never more kneel to the rising day,
Then thus I try thee shepherd, this same night,
That now comes stealing on, a gentle pair
Have promised equal love, and do appoint
To make yon wood the place, where hands and hearts
Are to be tied for ever: break their meeting
And their strong faith, and I am ever thine.
Tell me their names, and if I doe not move
(•y my great power) the center of their love
From his sixth being, let me never more,
Warm me, by those fair eyes I thus adore.
Come, as we go Isle tell thee what they are,
And give thee fit directions for thy work.
How have I wronged the times, or men, that thus,
After this holy feast I pass unknown,
And unsaluted? t'was not wont to be
Thus frozen with the younger company
Of jolly shepherds: t'was not then held good,
For lusty grooms to mix their quicker blood
With that dull humour: most unfit to be
The friend of man, cold and dull chastity:
Sure I am held not fair, or am too old,
Or else not free enough, or from my fouled
Drive not a flock sufficient great, to gain
The greedy eyes of wealth alluring swain.
Yet if I may believe what others say,
My face has foil enough, nor can they lay
Justly too strict a coyness to my charge.
My flocks are many, and the downs as large
They feed upon: then let it ever be
Their coldness, not my virgin modesty
Makes me complain.
Was ever man but I,
Thus truly taken with uncertainty?
Where shall that man be found that loves a mind
Made up in constancy, and dares not find
his love rewarded? here, let all men know,
A wretch that lives to love his mistress so.
Shepherd I pray thee stay, where haste thou been,
Or whether goosed thou? here be woods as greene
As any, ayre as fresh and sweet,
As where smooth Zephirus plays on the fleet
Face of the curled streams: with flowers as many
As the young spring gives, and as choice as any:
Here be all new delights, cool streams and wels,
Arbors are grown with wood bins, Caves, and dels,
Choose where thou wilt, whilst I sit by and sing,
Or gather rushes, to make many a ring
For thy long fingers, tell thee tales of love,
How the pale Phoebe hunting in a grove,
First saw the boy Endimion, from whose eyes,
She took eternal fire, that never dies,
How she conveyed him softly in a sleep,
His temples bound with poppy to the steep
Head of old Litmus, where she stoops each night,
Gilding the mountain with her brothers light
To kiss her sweetest.
Far from me are these
Hot flashes bred from wanton heat and ease,
I have forgot what love and loving meant,
Rimes, Songs, and merry rounds, that oft are sent
To the soft ear of Maid, are strange to me:
Only I live t'admire a chastity,
That neither pleasing age, smooth tongue, or gold,
Could ever break upon, so sure the mould
Is, that her mind was cast in: tic to her
I only am reserved, she is my form, I stir
By, breath, and move: tic she and only she
Can make me happy or give misery.
Good Shepherd, may a stranger crave to know,
To whom this dear observance you do owe?
Ye may, and by her virtue learn to square
And level out your life: for to be fair
And nothing virtuous, only fits the eye
Of gaudy youth, and swelling vanity.
Then know, shoe's called the virgin of the grove,
She that hath long since buried her chaste love,
And now lives by his grave, for whose dear soul
She hath vowed her self into the holy role
Of strict virginity, tic her I so admire,
Not any looser blood or new de•ire.
Farewell poor swain, thou art not for my bend,
I must have quicker souls, whose words may tend,
To some free action: give me him dare love
At first encounter, and as soon dare prove.
Come Shepherds come,
Come away without delay,
Whilst the gentle time doth stay,
Greene woods are dumme,
And will never tell to any,
Those dear kisses, and those many
Sweet embraces that are given,
Dainty pleasures that would even
Raise in coldest age a fire,
And give virgin blood desire.
Then if ever,
Now or never,
Come and have it,
Think not I,
Dare deny,
If you crave it.
Here comes another: better be my speed,
Thou God of blood, but certain if I read
Not false, this is that modest shepherd, he
That only dare salute, but ne'er could be
Brought to kiss any, hold discourse, or sing,
Whisper, or boldly ask that wished thing
We all are borne for: one that makes loving faces,
And could be well content to covet graces,
Were they not got by boldness: in this thing
My hopes are frozen, and but fate doth bring
Him heather, I would sooner choose
A man made out of snow, and fraser use
An Euuenke to my ends: but since hee is here,
Thus I attempt him: Thou of men most dear,
Welcome to her, that only for thy sake,
Hath been content to live: here boldly take
My hand in pledge, this hand, that never yet
Was given away to any: and but •it
Down on this rushy bank, whilst I go pull
Fresh blossoms from •he bows, or quickly cull
The choicest delicates from yonder mead,
To make thee chains or chaplets, or to spread
Under our fainting bodies, when delight
Shall locke up all our senses• how the sight
Of those smooth rising cheeks renew the story
Of young Atones, when in pride and glory
He lay enfolded twixt the beating arms
Of willing Venus: me thinks stronger charms,
Dwell in those speaking eyes: and on that brow
More sweetness then the painters can allow,
To their best pieces: not Narcissus he:
That wept himself away in memory
Of his own beauty, nor Siluanus boy,
Nor the twice ravished maid, for whom old Troy,
Fell by the hand of Pirrhus, may to thee,
Be otherwise compared then some dead tree
To a young fruitful Olive:
I can love, but I am loath to say so, least I prove
Too soon unhappy.
Happy thou would say,
My dearest Daphnis, blush not if the day
To thee and thy soft heats be enemy,
Then take the coming night, fair youth tic fre•
To all the world, shepherd Isle meet thee then
W•en darkness hath shut up the eyes of men,
In yonder gro•e: speak shall ou• meeting hold?
Indeed ye are too bashful, be more bold,
And tell me I.
I am content to say so,
And would be glad to meet, might I but pray so
Much from your fairness, that you would be true.
Shepherd thou hast thy wish,
Fresh maid adieu,
Yet one word more, since you have drawn me on
To come this night, fear not to meet alone,
That man that will not offer to be ill,
Though your bright self would ask it• for his fill
Of this worlds goodness: do not fear him then,
But keep your pointed time, let other men
Set up their bloods to sail, mine shall be ever,
Fair as the soul it carries, and unchaste never.
Yet am I poorer then I was before.
Is it not strange, among so many ascore
Of lusty bloods, I should pick out these things
whose veins like a dull river far from springs,
Is still the same, slow, heavy, and unfit
For stream or motion, though the strong winds hit
With their continual power upon his sides?
O happy be your names that have been brides:
And tasted those rare sweets, for which I pine,
And far more heavy be thy grief and tine.
Thou lazy swain that moist relieve my needs,
Then his upon whose liver always feeds
A hungry vulture.
Can such beauty be
Safe in his own guard, and not draw the eye
Of him that passes on to greedy gaze,
Or covetous desire, whilst in a maze
The better part contemplates, giving rain
And wished freedom to the labouring vain?
Fairest and whitest, may I crave to know,
The cause of your retirement, why ye go
Thus all alone? me thinks the downs are sweeter
And the young company of swains more meeter,
Then these forsaken and untrodden places.
Give not your self to lonenesse, and those graces
Hide from the eyes of men, that were intended
To live amongst vs swains.
Thou art befriended,
Shepherd in all my life, I have not seen,
A man in whom greater contents hath been,
Then thou thy self art: I could tell thee more,
Were there but any hope left to restore
My freedom lost: ô lend me all thy red,
Thou shamefaced morning, when from Tithons bed
Thou resist ever maiden.
If for me,
Thou sweetest of all sweets, these flashes be,
Speak and be satisfied, ô guide her tongue,
My better angel, force my name among
His modest thoughts, that the first word may be,
Alexis when the sun shall kiss the sea,
Taking his •est by the white Thetis side,
Meet in the holy wood, where Isle abide
Thy coming Shepherd.
If I stay behind,
An everlasting dullness and the wind,
That as he passes by shuts up the stream,
Of Reine or volga whilst the suns hot beam,
Beats back again, cease me, and let me turn
To coldenesse more then ice: oh how I burn
And rise in youth and fire! I dare not stay.
My name shall be your word.
Fly fly thou day,
My grief is great if both these boys should fail,
He that will use all winds must shift his sail.
Shepherds all, and maidens fair,
Fold your flocks up, for the Air
Gins to thicken, and the Sun
Already his great course hath run,
See the dew drops how they kiss
Every little flower that is:
Hanging on their velvet heads,
Like a rope of crystal beads.
See the heavy clouds load falling
And bright Hesperus down calling,
The dead night from under ground,
At whose rising mists unsound,
damps, and vapours fly apace,
Hovering ore the wanton face,
Of these pastures, where they come,
Striking dead both bud and bloom,
Therefore from such danger locke
Every one his loved flock,
And let your dogs lye loose without,
Least the Woolfe come as a scout
From the mountain, and ere day
Bear a Lamb or Kid away:
Or the crafty thievish Fox,
Break upon your simple flocks,
To secure your selves from these,
Be not too secure in ease,
Let one eye his watches keep,
Whilst the tother eye doth sleep.
So you shall good Shepherds prove,
And for ever hold the love
Of our great God: sweeeest slumbers
And soft silence fall in numbers
On your eye-lids: so farewell,
Thus I end my evenings knell.
Now let me know what my best Art hath done,
Helped by the great power of the virtuous moon,
In her full light, ô you sons of earth,
You only brood, unto whose happy birth
Virtue was given, holding more of nature
Then man her first borne &amp; most perfect creature.
Let me adore you, you that only can,
Help or kill nature, drawing out that span
Of life and breath, even to the end of time,
You that these hands did crop, long before prime
Of day, give me your names, and next your hidden power.
This is the Clo•• bearing a yellow flower:
And this black Horehound, both are very good,
For sheep or shepherd, bitten by a wood
Dogs venomed tooth, these Ramuns branches are,
Which stuck in entries, or about the bar
That holds the door fast, kill all the enchantments, charms,
Were they Medea• verses that do harms
To men or cattle: these for frenzy be
A •piety and a sovereign remedy.
The bitter Wormwood, Sage, and Marigold,
Such sympathy with mans good they do hold:
This Tormen•l whose virtue is to part
All deadly killing poison from the heart,
And here Narcissus root, for swellings best:
Yellow L•cimacus, to give sweet rest
To the faint Shepherd, killing where it comes,
All busy gnats, and every fly that hummes,
For leprosy, Darnel, and Sellondine,
With Calamined, whose ve•tues do resin
The blood of Man, making it free and fair,
As the first hour it breathed, or the best air.
Here other to, but your rebellious use,
Is not f•rme, whose goodness is abuse,
Therefore foul standergrasse, from me and mine
I banish thee, with lustful Turpentine,
You that entice the veins, and stir the heat
To civil mutiny, scaling the seat
Our reason moves in, and deluding it
With dreams and wanton fancies, till the fit
Of burning lust be quenched by appetite,
Robbing the soul of blessedness and light:
And thou light Var•in to, thou must go after
Provoking easy souls to mirth and laughter,
No more shall I dip thee in water now,
And sprinckle every post, and every bow
With thy well pleasing juice, to make the gromes,
Swell with high mirth as with joy all the romes.
This is the Cabin where the best of all
Her sex, that ever breathed, or ever shall
Give heat or happiness to the Shepherds side,
Doth only to her worthy self abide.
Thou blessed star, I thank thee for thy light,
Thou by whose power the darkness of sad night
Is banished from the earth, in whose dull place
Thy chaster beams play on the heavy face
Of all the world: making the blew sea smile,
To see how cunningly thou dost beguile
Thy brother of his brightness, giving day
Again from Chaos• whiter then that way
That leads to Ioues hye Court, and chaster far
Then chastity it self: yo• blessed star
That nightly shines, thou all the constancy
That in all women was, or ere shall be:
From whose fair eye-balles flies that holyfire,
That ports stile the mother of desire,
Infusing into every gentle breast,
A soul of greater price, and far more blessed
Then that quick power which gives a difference
Twixt man and creatures of a lower sense.
Shepherd how came thou hither to this place?
No way is trodden, all the verdant grass
The spring shot up stands yet vnbrused here
Of any foot, only the dappld dear:
Far from the feared sound of crooked horn
Dwells in this fastness.
Chaster then the morn,
I have not wandered, or by strong illusion
Into this virtuous place have made intrusion,
But hither am I come (believe me fair)
To seek you out, of whose great good the Air
Is full, and strongly labours, whilst the sound,
Breaks against heaven, and drives into a stround
The amazed Shepherd, that such virtue can
Be resident in lesser then a man.
If any art I have, or hidden skill,
May cure thee of disease or festered ill,
Whose grief or greenenesse to another eye,
May seem unpossible of remedy,
I dare yet undertake it.
Tic no pain
I suffer through disease, no beating vain
Conveys infection dangerous to the heart,
No part impostumde to be curd by Art:
This body holds, and yet a feller grief
Then ever skilful hand did give relief
Dwells on my soul, and may be heald by you,
Fair beauteous virgin:
Then shepherd let me sue
To know thy grief that man yet never knew
The way to health, that durst not show his sore.
Then fairest know I love you,
Swain no more.
Thou hast abused the strictness of this place,
And offred Sacrilegious foul disgrace
To the sweet rest of these interred bones,
For fear of whose ascending fly at once,
Thou and thy idle passions, that the sight
Of death and speedy vengeance may not fright.
Thy very soul with horror.
Let me not
Thou all perfection merit such a blot,
For my true zealous faith.
Dare thou abide
To see this holy earth at once divide
And give her body up, for sure it will,
If thou pursue with wanton flames to fill
This hallowed place: therefore repent and go,
Whilst I with prays appease his Ghost below,
That else would tell thee what it were to be,
A rival in that virtuous love, that he
Embraces yet.
Tic not the white or red
Inhabits in your cheek, that thus •an wed
My mind to adoration: nor your eye,
Though it be full and fair, your forehead hye,
And smooth as Pelops shoulder: not the smile
Lies watching in those dimples, to beguile
The easy soul, your hands and fingers long,
With veins inameld richly, nor your tongue,
Though it spoke sweeter then Arions Harp,
Your hair woven into many a curious warp,
Able in endless error to unfold
The wandering soul, not the true perfect mould,
Of all your body, which as pure doth show,
In Maiden whiteness as the Alpsien snow,
All these, were but your constancy away,
Would please me less then a black stormy day
The wretched Seaman toiling through the deep.
But whilst this honoured strictness you dare keep,
Though all the plagues that ere begotten were,
In the great womb of air were settled here
In opposition, I would like the tree,
Shake off those drops of weakness, and be free
Even in the arm of danger.
Would thou have
Me raise again fond man, from silent grave,
Those sparckes that long ago were buried here,
With my dead friends cold ashes?
Dearest dear,
I dare not ask it, nor you must not grant,
Stand strongly to your vow, and do not faint:
Remember how he loved ye, and be still,
The same opinion speaks ye, let not will,
And that great god of woven Appetite,
Set up your blood again, do not inuit
Desire, and fancy for their long exile,
To seat them once more in a pleasing smile:
Be like a Rock made firmly up against all
The power of angry heaven, or the strong fall
Of Neptunes battery, if ye yield I die
To all affection: tic that loyalty
Ye tie unto this grave I so admire,
And yet theres something else I would desire,
If you would hear me, but withal deny,
O Pan, what an uncertain destiny
Hanges over all my hopes! I will retire,
For if I longer stay, this double fire,
Will like my life up.
Do, and let time wear out,
What Art and Nature cannot bring about.
Farewell thou soul of virtue, and be blessed
For ever, whilst I wretched rest
Thus to my self, yet grant me leave to dwell
In kenning of this Arbor, yon •am dell
Ore topped with mourning Cyprus and sad Ewe,
Shall be my Cabin, where I'll early r•w,
Before the Sun hath kissed this dew away,
The hard uncertain chance which Fate doth lay
Upon this head.
The Gods give quick release
And happy cure unto thy hard disease.
I do not love this wench that I should meet,
For never did my inconstant eye yet greet
That beauty, were it sweeter or more fair,
Then the new blossoms, when the morning air
Blows gently on them, or the breaking light,
When many maiden blushes to our sight
Shoots from his early face: were all these set
In some neat form before me, twould not get
The least love from me: some desire it might,
Or present burning: all to me in sight
Are equal, be they fair, or black, or browne,
Virgin, or careless wanton, I can crown
My appetite with any: sweat as oft,
And weep as any, melt my words as soft
Into a maidens ears, and tell how long
My heart has been her servant, and how strong
My passions are: call her unkind and cruel,
Offer her all I have to gain the jewel
Maidens so highly praise: then loath and fly,
This do I hold a blessed destiny.
Hail Shepherd Pan bless both thy flock &amp; thee,
For being mindful of thy word to me.
Welcome fair Shepherdess, thy loving swain
Gives thee the self same wishes back again:
Who till this present hour ne'er knew that eye,
Could make me cross mine arms or daily dye
With fresh consumings: boldly tel me then,
How shall we part their faithful loves, and when•
Shall I belly him to her, shall I swear
His faith is false, and he loves every where?
Isle say he mocked her the other day to you,
Which will by your confirming show as true,
For he is of so pure an honesty,
To think (because he will not none will lye.
Or else to him Isle slander Amoret,
And say, she but seems chaste, Isle swear she •e•
Me amongst the shady sycamores last night,
And loosely offered up her flame and spright,
Into my bosom: made a wanton bed
Of leaves and many flowers, where she spread
Her willing body to be pressed by me,
There have I carved her name on many a tree,
Together with mine own, to make this show
Morefull of seeming: Hobinal you know,
Son to the aged Shepherd of the Glen
Him I have sorted out of many men,
To say he found vs at our private sport,
And roused vs fore our time by his resorts
This to confirm, I have promised to the boy
Many a pretty knack, and many a toy,
As grins to catch him birds with bow, and bolt,
To shoot at nimble squirrels in the holt:
A pair of painted buskins and a lamb,
Soft as his own lockes, or the down of Swan,
This I have done to win ye, which doth give
Me double pleasure, discord makes me live.
Loved swain I thank ye, these tricks might pre∣uaile
With other rus•icke shepherds, but will fail
Even once to stir, much more to overthrow,
His fixed love from judgment, who doth know,
Your nature, my end, and his chosens merit,
Therefore some stronger way must force his spirit
Which I have found: give second, and my love
Is everlasting thine.
Try me and prove.
These happy pair of lovers meet straight way,
Soon as they fouled their flocks up with the day
In the thick grove bordering upon yon hill,
In whose hard side Nature hath carved a well:
And but that matchless spring which Poets know,
Was ne'er the like to this: by it doth grow
About the sides, all herbs which witches use,
All simples good for medicine or abuse,
All sweets that crown the happy nuptial day.
With all their colours, there the month of May
Is ever dwelling, all is young and greene,
There's not a grass on which was ever seen,
The falling Autume or cold winters hand
So full of heate and virtue is the land:
About this fountain: which doth slowly break
Below yon Mountains foot, into a creek
That waters all the valley, giving fish
Of many sorts, to fill the shepherds dish.
This holy well, my Grandam that is dead,
Right wise in charms, hath often to me sed,
Hath power to change the form of any creature,
Being thrice dipped over the head, into what feature,
Or shape t'would please the letter down to crave,
Who must pronounce this charm to, which she gave
Me on her death bed, told me what and how
I should apply unto the patients brow,
That would be changed, casting them thrice a sleep
Before I trusted them into this deep.
All this she showed me, and did charge me prove,
This secret of her Art, if crossed in love,
I'll this attempt, now Shepherd I have here
All her prescriptions• and I wi•l not fear
To be my self dipped: come, my temples bind
With these sad herbs, and when I sleep you find
As you do speak your charm, thrice down me let,
And bid the water raise me Amoret,
Which being done, leave me to my affair,
And ere the day shall quite it self out wear,
I will return unto my Shepherds arm,
Dip me again, and then repeat this charm,
And pluck me up my self, whom freely take,
And the hotst fire of thine affection slake.
And if I fit thee not, then fit not me,
I long the truth of this wels power to see.
Here will I stay, for this the covert is
Where I appointed Cloe, do not miss:
Thou bright eyed virgin, come, ô come my fair,
Be not abused with fear, nor let cold care
Of honour slay thee from thy Shepherds arm,
Who would as hard be won to offer harm
To thy chaste thoughts, as whiteness from the day,
Or yon great round to move another way.
My language shall be honest, full of truth,
My flame as smooth and spotless as my youth:
I will not entertain that wandering thought,
Whose easy currant may at length be brought
To a loose vastenes.
 Cloe!
Tic her voice
And I must answer, Cloe! ô the choice
Of dear embraces, chaste and holy strains
Our hands shall give! I charge you all my veins
Through which the blood and spirit take their way,
Lo•ke up your disobedient heats, and stay
Those mutinous desires, that else would grow
To strong rebellion: do not wilder show
Then blushing modesty may entertain.
 Cloe!
There sounds that blessed name again,
And I will meet it: let me not mistake,
This is some Shepherd, sure I am awake,
What may this riddle mean? I will retire,
To give my self more knowledge
Oh my fire,
How thou consum'st me? Cloe answer me,
Alexis, strong Alexis, high, and free,
Calls upon Cloe: see mine arms are full
Of entertainment, ready for to pull
That golden fruit which too too long hath hung,
T•mpting the greedy eye: thou stayest too long,
I am impatient of these mad delays,
I must not leave unsought those many ways
That lead into this center, till I find
Quench for my burning lust, I come unkind.
Can my imagination work me so much ill,
That I may credit this for truth, and still
Believe mine eyes, or shall I firmly hold her
Her yet untainted, and these sights but bold
Illusion? sure such fancies oft have been
Sent to abuse true love, and yet are seen,
Daring to blind the virtuous though with error,
But be they far from me with their fond terror:
I am resolved my Cloe yet is true.
Cloe hark Cloe sure this voice is new,
Whose shrillness like the sounding of a bell,
Tells me it is a woman: Cloe, tell
Thy blessed name again
Oh what a grief is this to be so near
And not encounter?
Shepherd we are met,
Draw close into the co•ert, least the wet
which falls like lazy mists upon the ground,
Soak through yous startvps.
Fairest, are you found
How have we wandered that the better part
Of this good night is perished? oh my heart!
How have I longed to meet ye? how to kiss
Those lily hands? how to receive the bliss
That charming tongue gives to the happy ear
Of him that drinks your language? but I fear
I am too much vnmannerd, far to rude,
And almost grown lasciuous to intrude
These hot behaviours, where regard of fame,
Honour, and modesty, a virtuous name,
And such discourse, as one fair sister may
Without offence unto the brother say,
Should rather have been tendered, but believe
Here dwells a better temper, do not grieve,
Then ever kindest that my first salute,
Seasons so much of fancy, I am mute
Hence•orth to all discourses, but shall be
Suiting to your sweet thoughts and modesty:
Indeed I will not ask a kiss of you,
No not to wring your fingers, nor to sue
To those blessed pair of fixed stars for smiles,
All a young lovers cunning, all his wiles:
And pretty wanton dyings shall to m•
Be strangers, only to your Chastity
I am devoted ever.
Honest swain,
First let me thank you, then return again
As much of my love: no thou art too cold
Unhappy boy, not tempered to my mold,
Thy blood false heavy downward, tic not fear
To offend in boldness wins, they never wear
deserved favours that deny to take
When they are offred freely: do I wake
To see a man of his youth, years and feature,
And such a one as we call goodly creature,
Thus backward? what a world of precious Art,
Were merely lost, to make him do his part?
But I will shake him off, that dares not hold,
Let men that hope to be beloud be bold,
Daphnis I do desire since we are met
So happily, our lives and fortunes set,
Upon one stake to give assurance now,
By interchange of hands and holy vow,
Never to break again: walk you that way,
Whilst I in zealous meditation •tray
A little this way when wee both have ended
These rights and duties by the woods befriended,
And secrecy of night, retire and find
An aged oak whose hollowness may bind
Vs both within his body, thither go:
It stands within yon bottom••
Be it so
And I will meet there never more with thee,
Thou idle shamefastness,
 Cloe!
Tic hee.
That dare I hope be bolder.
Cloe.
now
Great Pan for Sirinx sake bid speed our plow.
From thy forehead thus I take
These herbs, and charge thee not awake,
Till in yonder holy well,
Thrice with powerful magic spell,
Filled with many a baleful word,
Thou hast been dipped, thus with my cord
Of blasted hemp, by moone-light twinned,
I do thy sleepy body bind,
I turn thy head into the East,
And thy feet into the West,
Thy left arm to the South put forth,
And thy right unto the North:
I take thy body from the ground,
In this deep and deadly sound:
And into this holy spring,
I let thee slide down by my string:
Take this maid thou holy pit
To thy bottom, nearer yet,
In thy water pure and sweet,
By thy leave I dip her feet:
Thus I let her lower yet,
That her anckles may be wet:
Yet down lower, let her knee
In thy waters washed bee,
There stop: Fly away Every thing that loves the day,
Truth that hath but one face,
Thus I charm thee from this place.
Snakes that cast your coats for new,
Chameleons, that alter hue,
Hares that yearly sexes change,
Proteus altering oft and strange,
Haecatae with shapes three,
Let this maiden changed be,
With this holy water wet, To the shape of Amoret:
Cynthia work thou with my charm,
Thus I draw thee free from harm,
Up out of this blessed lake,
Rise both like her and awake.
Speak shepherd, am I Amoret to sight?
Or hast thou mist in any magic right?
For want of which any defect in me,
May make our practises discovered be?
By yonder moon, but that I here do stand,
Whose breath hath thus reformd thee, and whose hand,
Let thee down dry, and plucked thee up thus wet,
I should my self take thee for Amoret,
Thou art in clothes, in feature, voice and hew
So like, that sense can not distinguish you.
Then this deceit which cannot crossed be,
At once shall loose her him, and gain thee me.
Hither she needs must come, by promise made,
And sure his nature never was so bad,
To bid a virgin meet him in the wood,
When night and fear are up, but understood,
T'was his part to come first: being come, Isle say
My constant love made me come first and stay,
Then will I lead him further to the grove,
But stay you here, and if his own true love
shall seek him here, set her in some wrong path,
Which say her lover lately trodden hath:
Isle not be far from hence, if need there bee
Here is another charm, whose power will free
The dazzled sense read by the moon beams clear,
And in my one true shape make me appear.
Stand close, heeee's Perigot, whose constant heart,
Longs to behold her, in whose shape thou art.
This is the place (fair Amoret) the hour
Is yet scarce come, here every sylvan power
Delights to be, about yo• sacred well,
Which they have blessed with many a powerful spell,
For never travailer in dead of night,
Nor strayed beasts have fallen in, but when •ight,
Hath failed them, then their right way they have found,
By help of them, so holy is the ground,
But I will farther seek, least Amoret
Should be first come and so stray long vnmet.
My Amoret, Amoret!
 Perigot!
Per My love! A•april. I come my love.
Now she hath got
Her own desires, and I shall gainer be
Of my long looked for hopes as well as she;
How bright the moon shines here, as if she strove
To show her glory in this little grove
To some new loved Shepherd: yonder is
Another Amoret: where differs this
From that, but that she Perigot hath met,
I should have tan this for the counterfeit:
Herbs, woods, and springs, the power that in you lies,
If mortal men could know your properties.
Me thinks it is not night, I have no fear,
Walking this wood of Lyon, or of Bear,
Whose names at other times, have made me quake,
When any shepherdess in her tale spake,
Of some of them, that underneath a wood
Have torn true lovers that together stood.
Me thinks there are no goblins, and men's talk,
That in these woods the nimble Faieries walk,
Are fables, such a strong hart I have got,
Because I come to meet with Perigot,
My Perigot, whose that my Perigot?
Fair Maid.
Ay me thou art not Perigot.
But I can tell ye news of Perigot,
An hour together under yonder tree,
He sat with wreathed arms and called on thee,
And said, why Amoret staiest thou so long:
Then starting up down yonder path he flung,
Least thou had mist thy way: were it day light
He could not yet have borne him out of sight.
Thanks gentle Shepherd and beshrew my stay,
That made me fearful I had lost my way:
As fast as my weakelegs, (that cannot be
Weary with seeking him) will carry me,
Isle follow, and for this thy care of me,
Pray Pan thy love may ever follow thee.
How bright she was? how lovely did she show?
Was it not pity to deceive her so?
She plucked her garments up and tripped away,
And with a virgin innocence did pray
For me, that periurd her: whilst she was here,
Me thought the beams of light that did appear,
Were shot from her: me thought the moon gave none,
But what it had from her: she was alone
With me, if then her presence did so move,
Why did not I assay to win her love?
She would not sure have yielded unto me,
Women love only opportunity
And not the man, or if she had denied
Alone, I might have forced her to have tried
Who had been stronger: ô vain fool, to let
Such blessed occasion pass, Isle follow yet,
My blood is up, I cannot now forbear.
I come sweet Amoret, soft who is here?
A pair of lovers, he shall yield her me,
Now lust is up, alike all women be.
Where shall we rest, but for the love of me,
Cloe I know ere this would weary be.
Alexis let vs rest here, if the place
Be private, and out o• the common trace
Of every shepherd: for I understood,
This night a number are about the wood,
Then let vs choose some place where out of sight,
We freely may enjoy our stolen delight,
Then boldly here, where we shall ne'er be found,
No shepherds way lies here, tic hallowed ground,
No maid seeks here her strayed Cow, or Sheep,
Faieries and Fawns, and Satires do it keep,
Then carelessly rest here, and clip and kiss,
And let no fear make vs our pleasures miss.
Then lye by me, the sooner we begin,
The longer ere day descry our sin.
Forbear to touch my love, or by yon flame
The greatest power that Shepherds dare to name,
Here where thou first under this holy tree,
Her to dishonour thou shalt buried be.
If Pan himself should come out of the lawns,
With al his troops of Satyrs and of Fauns,
And bid me leave I swear by her two eyes,
A greater oath then thine, I would not rise.
Then from the cold earth never thou shalt move,
But loose at one stroke both thy life and love.
Hold gentle Shepherd.
Fairest Shepherdess,
Come you with me, I do not love ye less
Then that fond man that would have kept you there
From me of more desert.
O yet forbear
To take her from me, give me leave to die
By her.
Now whilst theme one doth rule the sky,
And the stars, whose feeble light
Give a pale shadow to the night,
Are up, great Pan commanded me
To walk this grove about, whilst he
In a corner of the wood,
Where never mortal foot hath stood,
Keeps dancing, music and a feast,
To entertain a lovely guest:
Where he gives her many a rose
Sweeter then the breath that blows
The leaves: grapes, beries of the best,
I never saw so great a feast.
But to my charge: here must I stay,
To see what mortals loose their way,
And by a false fire seeming bright,
Train them in and leave them right:
Then must I watch if any be
Forcing of a chastity,
If I find it, then in haste,
Give my wreathed horn a blast,
And the faieries all will run,
Wildely dancing by the moon,
And will pinch him to the bone,
Till his lustful thoughts be gone.
O death•
Back again about this ground
Sure I hear a mortal sound,
I bind thee by this powerful spell,
By the waters of this well:
By the glimmering moon beams bright,
Speak again thou mortal wight.
Oh
Speak again thou mortal wight,
Here the foolish mortal lies,
Sleeping on the ground, arise,
The poor wight is almost dead,
On the Ground his wounds have bled,
And his Clothes fouled with his blood,
To my Goddess in the wood,
Will I lead him, whose hands pure,
Will help this mortal wight to cure,
Since I beheld, you shaggy Man, my breast,
Doth pant, each bush me thinks should hide a Beast,
Yet my desire, keeps still aboue my fear,
I would fine meet some Shepherd knew I where,
For from one cause of fear, I am most free,
It is Impossible to Ravish me,
I am so willing, here upon this ground,
I left my love all Bloody wi•h his wound,
Yet till that fearful shape made me be gone,
Though he were hurt, I furnished was of one,
But now both lost• Alexis speak or move,
If thou hast any life thou art yet my love,
Hoe's dead, or else is with his little might,
Crept from the Bank for fear of that ill spright,
Then where art thou that strike my love• o stray,
Bring me thy self in Change, and then Isle say,
Thou hast some Justice, I will make thee trim,
With Flowers, and Garlands, that were meant for him,
Isle Clip thee round, with both mine arms as fast,
As I did mean, he should have bin embraced.
But thou art fled what hope is left for me?
Isle run to Daphnis in the hollow tree.
Who I did mean to mock, though hope be small,
To make him bold, rather then none at all,
Isle try him, his heart, and my behaviour to
Perhaps may teach him, what he ought to doe.
This was the place, it was but my feeble sight,
Mixed with the horror of my deed, an night,
That shaped theise fears• and made me run away,
And loose my Beauteous hardly gotten Pray,
Speak Gentle Sheappardess I am alone,
And tender love, for love, but she is gone,
From me, that having struke her lover dead:
For filly fear left her a lone and fled:
And see the wounded Body is Removed.
By her of whom it was so well beloved.
But all theise fancies must be quite for go•t,
I must lye close here comes young Perigott,
with subtle Amarillis in the shape,
Of Amoret pray love hee may not scope.
Beloved Perigot, show me some place,
Where I may rest my Li•bes, weak with the Chase•
Of thee• an hour before thou came at least
Beshrew my Tardy steps, here shalt thou rest
Upon this holy bank no deadly snake,
Upon this Turf her self in folds doth make,
Here is no poison, for the Toad• to feed.
H•re •oldly spread thy hands, no venomed weed,
Dares blister them, No sly my snail dare creep,
Over thy face when thou art fast a sleep,
Here never durst the babbling Cuckoo spit.
No slough off •ing Starr did ever hit.
Upon this Bank• let this thy Cabin bee.
This other set with violets for me.
Thou dost not lone me Perigot?
Fair maid
You only l•ue to hear it often said;
You do n•t •oubt,
Believe me, but I doe.
What shall wee now begin again to woe,
Tic the best way to make your lover last,
To play with him, when you have caught him fast,
By I an I swear, beloved Perigot,
And by you Moon, I think thou love me not.
By Pan I swear and if I falsely swear:
Let him not guard my flocks, let Foxes tear,
My Earelyest lambs, and wolves whilst I doe steep
Fall one the rest a Rot among my sheep,
I love the better, then the careful Ewe,
The new yeand lamb that is of her own hew,
I dote upon thee more t•en that young l•mbe.
Doth on the Bag, that feeds him from his dam.
W•re there a sort of wolves go•t in my fouled,
And one Ran after thee both young and old,
Should be devoured, and it should bee my strife,
To save thee, whom I love aboue, my life,
Howe should I trust thee when I see thee choose
Another bed, and dost my side refuse,
It was only that the chaste thoughts, might bee shown,
Tu•xt thee and me, although we were alone,
Come Perigot will show his power that hee
Can make his Amoret, though she weary bee,
Rise nimbly from her Couch and come to his.
Here take thy Amoret embrace, and Kiss:
What mean• my love;
To do as lovers shut.
That are to bee enjoyed not to bee wood.
Ther's •ere a Shepherd esse in all the plain,
Can kiss thee with more Art, ther's none can fine.
More wanton tricks,
Forbear dear soul to t•ye,
Whether my hart be pure, Isle rather dye,
Then nourish one thought to dishonour thee,
Still think thou such a thing as Chastity,
Is amongst women. Perigot theirs none,
That with her love is in a wood alone,
And wood come home a Maid be not abused,
With thy •and first belief, let time be used,
Why dost thou rise,
My true heart, thou hast slain,
Faith Perigot, Isle pluck thee down again,
Let go thou Serpent that into my breast,
Hast with thy Cunning dived art, art not iniest;
Sweet love lye down,
Since this I live to see,
Some bitter North wind blast my flocks and me
You swore you loved yet will not doe my will,
O be as thou were, once, Isle love thee still,
I am, as still I was and all my kind,
Though other shows wee have poor men to blind,
Then here I end all love, and lest my vain,
Beleei•e should ever draw me in again,
Before thy face that hast my youth mislead,
I end my life my blood be on thy head,
O hold thy hands thy Amoret doth cry,
Thou c•unsayl'st well, first Amoret shall dye,
That is the cause of my Eternal smart,
O hold.
This steel shall peirse thy lustful hart,
up and down every where,
I strew the herbs to purge the Air•
Let your Odor drive hence,
All mists that dazzle sense,
Herbs and springs whose hidden migh••
Alters shapes, and mocks the sight.
Thus I charge ye to undo;
All before I brought ye to•
Let her fly let her scope,
Give again her own shape:
For bear thou gentle swain thou dost mistake;
She whom thou followed fled into the brake•
And as I crossed thy way I met thy wrath;
The only fear of which near slain me hath,
Pardon fair Shepherds•e my rage and night,
Were both upon me and beguiled my sight;
But far be it from me to spill the blood.
Of harmless maids that wander in the wood,
Many a weary step in yonder path
Poor hopeless Amoret twice trodden hath,
To seek her Perigot, yet cannot hear,
His voice, my •erigot, she loves thee dear:
That calls.
See yonder where she is how fair.
She shows, and yet her breath infects the Air.
My Perigot:
Here.
Happy.
Haplesse first:
It lights, on thee, the next blow is the worst,
Stay Perigot, my love, tho• art unjust:
Death is the best reward, thats due to lust;
Now shall their love be crossed, for being struck;
Isle throw her in the Fount least being took:
By some Night Travailer, whose honest care,
May help to cure her, Sherpardesse prepare,
Your self to dye,
No mercy I doe crave•
Thou can not give a worse blow then I have;
Tell him that gave me this, who loved him to•
He struck my soul and not my body through:
Tell him when I am dead my soul shall bee.
At peace if hee but think hee iniurd me•
In this Fount bee thy Grave, thou were not meant,
Sure for a woman, thou art so Innocent•
She cannot scope for underneath the ground,
In a lunge h•llowe the clear spring is bound,
Till on you side where the Morns sun doth look•

For thy kindness to me shown,
Never from thy banks be blown,

With tawny Buskins, and thee hook she bears
Of thine own Carving, where your names are set,
Wrought underneath with many a Curious fret
The prim-Rose Chaplet? taudry-lace and Ring,
Thou gave her for her singing with each thing,
Else that she wears about her let me feel;
The first tell stroke of that Revenging steel?
I am contented if there bee a hope;
To give it Entertainment for the scope;
Of one poor hour; go you shall find me next?
Under you shady Beech? even thus perplexed;
And thus believing.
Bind before I go;
Thy soul by Pan unto me, not to doe,
Harm or outrageous wrong upon thy life,
Till my Return.

When Golden Midst, judged their Minstralcye;

Softly gliding as I go;
With this Burden full of woe;
Through still silence of the night?
Guided by the glooe-wormes light.
Hither am I come at last;
Many a Thicket hane I past;
Not at twig that durst deny me;
Nor a bush t•at durst descry me.
To the little Bird that sleeps:
On the tender spray nor creeps,
That hardly worm with pointed Tail;
But if I bee under sail;
Flying faster then the wind;
Leaving all the Clouds behind,
But doth hide her tender head,
In some hollow Tree o• bed;
Of •eeded Nettells not a Hare
Can be started from his fare;
By my footing nor a wish;
Is more sudden, nor a fish?
Can bee found; with greater ease,
Cut the vast unbounded seas;
Leaving neither print nor •and.

I measure many a leage an hour;
But behold the happy bower,
That must ease me of my charge,
And by holy hand enlardge;

Lies fast bound in dead lice•t,

Thy virtuous help to keep from Grave,
This poor Mortal that here lies,
Waiting when thee destinies.

Trenched into him•
What art thou? call me from my holy Rights
And with the feared name of death a frights
My tender Ears, speak me thy name and will,
I am the Statyre that did fill,
Your lapp with early fruit and will,
When I hap to gather more,
Bring ye better, and more store:
Yet I come not empty now,
See a blossom from the bow,
But be shrew his hart that pulled it,
And his perfect Sight that Culld it,
From the other springing blooms
For a sweeter youth the Gwomes
Cannot show me nor the downs:
Nor the many neighbouring Towns,
Low in yonder glade I found him,
Softly in mine Arms I bound him,
Hither have I brought him sleeping,
In a Trance, his wounds fresh weeping,
In remembrance such youth may
Spring and perish in a Day.
Satire: they wrong thee, that doe term thee rude
Though thou be outward rough and tawny hued:
Thy manners are as gentle and as fair,
As his who brags himself, borne only heir,
To all Humanity: let me see thie wound:
This Herb will stay the Currant being bound,
Fast to the Or•physe, and this restrain,
Vicers, and Swellinges, and such inward payne,
As the cold Ayre hath forced into the sore,
This to, draw out such Putrifiing gore,
As inward falls.
Heaven grant it may doe good,
Fairly wipe away the blood,
Hold him gently till I fling,
Water of a virtuous spring:
On his Temples tu•no him twice:
To the Moon beams pinch him thrice:
That the labouring soul may draw.
From his great ecclip•e.
I saw.
His Eye-lids mooing.
Give him breath,
All the danger of cold death:
Now is vanished, with this plaster:
And this unction doe I moister:
All the festered ill that may:
Give him grief another day.
See hee gathers up his spright
And begins to hunt for light,
Now a gapes and breathes again:
How the blood runs to the vain:
That east was employ.
Oh my hart,
My dearest, dearest Cloe O the smart,
Runs, through my side: I feel some pointed thing,
Pass through my Bowels, sharper then the sting,
Of Scorpion.
Pan, preserve me, what are you,
Doe not hurt me. I am true,
To my Cloe though she fly
And leave me to this Destiny,
There she stands, and will not lend,
Her smooth white hand to help her friend,
But I am much mistaken, for that face,
Bears more Austerity and modest grace,
More reproving and more awe.

In my Cloe, oh my payne:
Eagerly Renews again:
Give me your help for his sake you love best:
Shepherd thou Can not possible take rest.
Till thou hast laid a side all heats, dossiers,
Provoking thoughts, that stir up lusty fierce.
Commerce with wanton Eyes: strong blood and will,
To execute theise must bee purged until,
The vain grow Whiter then Repent and pray:
Great Pan, to keep you from the like decay,
And I shall undertake your cure with ease.
Till when this virtuous Plasters will displease,

To catch the nimble wind or get,
Shadows gliding on the greene,
Or to steal from the great Queen,
Of Fairies, all her Beauty,

Doe I owe those precious Eyes,

On this bower may ever dwell,
Spring, and summer.
Friend farewell.
This place is Ominous sor here I lost,
My love and almost life, and since have crossed,
All theise woods over, never a Nook or dell,
Where any li•tle Bird, or beast doth dwell,
But I have sought it• never a bending brow,
Of any hill or Glade, the wind sings through,
Nor a greene bank or shade when•e Sheapeards use,
To si•t and Riddle sweetly pipe or choose,
Their valentines• but I have mist to find.
My love in, Perigot, Oh to unkind.
Why hast thou fled me? whether art thou gone,
Howe have I wronged thee? was my love alone,
To thee, worthy this scorned Recompense? tic well,
I am content to fee• eit; but I tell
Thee Shepherd: and theise lusty woods shall hear.
Forsaken Aomret• is yet as clear,
Of any stranger fire, as Heaven is.
From foul Corruption, or the deep: Abisse,
From light, and happiness, and thou may know,
All this for truth and how that fatal blow,
Thou gave me, never from desert of mine,
Fell on my life, but from suspect of thine,
Or fury more then Madness therefore, here.
Since I have lost my life, my love, my dea•e,
Upon this cursed place, and on this greene,
That first divorced vs, shortly shall bee seen,
A sight of so great pity that each eye,
Shall daily spen• his spring in memory.
Of my untimely fall.
I am not blind,
Nor is it through the working of my Mind.
That this shows Amoret, for sake me all,
That dwell upon the soul, but what men call
Wonder, or more then wonder Miracle,
For sure so strange as this the Oracle,
Never gave answer of, It passes dreams,
Or maddmens fancy when the many streams,
Of new Imagination rise and fall:
Tic but an hour since theise Ears heard her call,
For pity to young Perigot? whils•hee,
Directed by his fury Bloodelye,
Lanch't up• her breast, which bloodless fell and cold,
And if belief may Credit what was told,
After all this the Melancholy Swain,
Took her into his Arms being almost slain.
And to the bottom of the holy well,
slung her for ever with the waives to dwell,
Tic she, the very same, tic Amoret.
And living yet, the great powers will not let,
Their virtuous love be Crossed, maid wipe away,
Those heavy drops of sorrow, and allay,
The storm that yet goes high, which not depressed,
Breaks, hart, and life, and all before it rest:
Thy Perigot:
where: which is Perigot.
Sits there below lamenting much God wott:
Thee, and thy fortune, go and comfort him,
And thou shalt find him under neath a brim,
Of sailing Pines that edge yon Mountaiue in,

His soul again.

And warm our bloods together till the sit;
Come lively on vs;
Friend you are to keen;
The Morning, Rises, and wee shall be seen,
For bear a little;

Hold Shepherd hold, learn not to bee a wronger;
Of your word, was not your promise laid,
To break their loves first:
I have done it Maid?
No they are yet vnbroken, met again,
And are as hard to part yet as the stain?
Is from the finest lawn,
I say they are.

That they shall never meet,

For do but to yon hanging Mountain go,
And there believe your eyes,

Of with delays: and trifles, fare well cold,
And frozen bash•ullnes, unfit for men,
Thus I salute thee virgin,
And thus then,
I bid you follow, Catch me if ye can,
And If I stay behind I am no Man.

Where never sun beam, shot his wholesome light,

This is the bottom: speak if thou be here,
My Perigot, thy Amoret, thy dear,
Calls on thy loved Name,
What thou dare,
Tread theise forbidden paths, where death and care,
Dwell on the face of darcknes,
Tic thy friend,
Thy Amoret come hither to give end,
To theise consumings look up gentle Boy,
I have forgot those pains, and dear annoy,
I suffered for thy sake, and am content,
To bee thy love again why hast thou rent,
Those curled lockes, where I have often hung,
Ribbons and damask Roses, and have flung,
Waters distilld to make thee fresh and gay,
Sweeter then Nose-gayes on a Bridal day,
Why dost thou cross thine Arms, and hang thy face,
Down to thy Bosom, letting fall apace,
From those too little Heavens upon the ground
Showers of more price, more Orient, &amp; more round
Then those that hang upon the moons pale brow
Cease theise complainings Shepherd I am now,
The same, I ever was, as kind and free,
And can forgive before you ask of me,
Indeed I can, and will.
So spoke my fair,
O you great working powers of Earth, and Ayre,
Water, and forming fire, why have you lent,
Your hidden virtues of so ill intent,
Even such efface, so fair so bright of hew,
Had Amoret, such, words •so smooth and new,
Came flowing from her tongue, such was her eye,
And such the pointed sparckle that did fly•
Forth like a bleeding shaft, all is the same,
The Robe, and Buskins, painted, hook, and frame,
Of all her Body O me Amoret,
Shepherd what means this Riddle who hath set,
So strange a difference, twixt my self and me,
That I am grown another, look and see.
The Ring thou gave me, and about my wrest.
That Curious Braeslet thou thy self did twist.
From those fair Tresses, know thou Amoret.
Hath not some newer love forced thee forget,
Thy Ancient faith,
Still nearer to my love;
Theise be the very words she oft did prove,
Upon my temper, so she still wot take,
wonder into her face, and silent make,
Singes with her head and hand as who wot say
Shepherd remember this another day:
Am I not Amoret. where was I lost,
Can there be Heaven, and time, and men• most
Of theise inconstant? faith where art thou fled?
Are all the vows and protestations dead:
The hands held up? the wishes and the hart?
Is there not one remayningne not apart,
Of all theise to bee found why then I see:
Men never knew that virtue constancy
Men ever were most blessed, till Cross fate,
Brought love, and women forth unfortunate,
To all that ever tasted of their smiles,
Whose Actions are all double, full of wiles,
Like to the subtle Hare, that fore the Hounds,
Makes many turnings leaps and many rounds,
This way and that way, to deceive the sent,
Of her p•rsuers:
Tic but to prevent,
There speedy coming, on that seek her fall,
The hands of Cruel men• more Bestial,
And of a nature more refusing good,
Then beasts themselves, or fishes of the flood,
Thou art all theise, and more then nature meant,
When she created all, frowns, joys, content:
Extreme fire for an hour, and presently:
Colder then sleepy poison: or the sea,
Upon whose face sitts a continual frost
Your Actions ever driven to the most,
Then down again as lowe that none can find,
The rise or falling of a woman's mind,
Can there bee any Age, or days, or time,
Or tongues: of Men, guilty so great a crime:
As wronging simple Maid, O Perigot:
Tho• that wast yesterday without a blott,
Thou that wast every good• and every thing,
That men call blessed: thou that wast the spring.
From whence our looser grooms drewall their best:
Thou that wast always Just, and always blessed,
In faith and promise, thou that had the name,
Of virtuous given thee, and made good the same:
Even from thy Cradle: thou that wast that all,
That men delighted in, Oh what a fall,
Is this to have been so, and now to bee,
The only best in wrong, and infamy,
And I to live to know this, and by me.
That loved thee dearer then, mine Eyes or that,
Which wee esteem our honour virgin state,
Dearer then swallows love the early morn,
Or dogs of Chase the souud of merry Horn,
Dearer then thou can love thy new love, if thou hast•
Another and far dearer then the last,
Dea•er then thou can love thy self, though all,
The self love were wîthin thee, that did fall.

For whose dear sake, Echo weeps many a shower
And am I thus rewarded for my flame,
Loved worthily to get a wantons name,
Come thou forsaken willow wind my head,
And noise it to the world, my love is dead:
I am forsaken I am Cast away,
And left for every lazy Grome to say,
I was inconstant light, and sooner lost,
Then the quick Clouds wee see or the Chill •roast,
When the hot sun beats on it tell me yet,
Can thou not lone again thy Amorett?
Thou art not worthy of that blessed name,

With words and feigned passi•ns, Perigot,

And hear me woods and and silence of this place,

Hear me ye shadows, that delight to dwell,
In horrid darkness, and ye powers of Hell,

The careless Prodigal: and gave away:

And thus with much belief, I was be guild,

Sure these wanton Swains are wood,
Can there be a hand, or hart,
Dare commit so wild a part,
As this Murder, by the Moon,
That hydd her self when this was done,
Never was a sweeter face,
I will bear her to the place,
Where my Goddess keeps and crave,
Her to give her life, or grave,
Here whilst one patient takes his rest secure
I steal a broad to doe another Cure,
Pardon thou buried body of my love,
That from thy side I dare so soon remove,

And seeing thy fair Clorins, Cabin dye,
O hapless love which being answered ends,
And as a little Infant cries and bends,
Hist tender Brows, when rolling of his eye,
He hath espied some thing that glisters ny.
Which he would have, yet give it him, away,
He throws it straight, and cries a fresh to play
With some thing else such my affection set,
On that which I should loath if I could geett

To her dead lover which she needs must end,
Before she can allow him, for her friend,
And he himself, must needs the cause destroy,
For which he loves, before he can enjoy,
Poor Shepherd, Heaven grant I at once may free,
Thee from thy payne, and keep my loyalty,
Shepherd look up,
Thy brightness doth amaze,
So Phoebus may at Noon bid mortals gaze,
Thy glorious constancy appears so bright,
I dare not meet the Beams with my weakesight
Why dost thou pine away thy self for me
Why dost thou keep such spotless constancy?
Thou holy Shepherd see what for thy sake,
Clorin, thy Clorin, now dare undertake, he starts up
Stay there, thou constant Clorin if there bee,
Yet any part of woman left in thee,
To make thee light think yet before thou speak,
See what a holy vow, for thee I break,
I that already have my fame •arr spread,
For being constant to my lover dead
think yet dear Clorin of your love, how true,
If you had dyed, he would have been to you
Yet all Isle loose for thee.
Think but how blessed,
A constant woman is aboue the rest,
And offer up my self, here on this •round,
To be disposed by thee,
why dost thou wound,
His hart with Malice, against women more.
That hated all the Sex, but thee before,
How much more pleasant had it been to me,
To dye then behold this change in thee,
Yet, ye•• return: let not the woman swaye,
In sult not on her now, nor use delay
Who for thy sake hath ventured all her fame,
Thou hast not ventured but bought Certain shame,
Your Sexes Curse, foul falsehood, must and shall,
I see once in your lives light on you all;
I hate thee now: yet turn
Be just to me:
Shall I at once• loose both my fame and thee,
Thou had no fame, that which thou did like good
Was but thy Appetite that swayed thy blood,
For tha• time to the best, for as a blast,
That through a nouse comes, usually doth cast,
Things out of order: yet by chance may come,
And blow some one thing to his proper rome,
So did thy Appetite, and not thy zeal.
Swaye the by chance to do some one thing well.
Yet turn.
Thou dost but try me if I would.
Forsake thy dear embraces for my old
Loves though he were alive, but doe not fear•
I doe contemn thee now: and dare come near.
And gays upon thee, for me thinks that grace:
Austerity, which sat upon that •ace,
Is gone, and thou like others false maid see,
This is the gain of foul Inconstancy,
Tic done great: Pan, I give thee thanks for it,
What Art could not have heald, is curd by wit,
Will ye be constant yet, will ye remove,
Into the Cabin to your buried love,
No let me dye, but by thy side remain,
Ther's none shall know that thou did ever stain,
Thy worthy stricknes, but shalt honoured bee
And I will lye again under this tree,
And pine and dye for thee with more delight,
Then I have sorrow now to know thee light,
Let me have thee, and Isle be where thou wilt.
Thou art of women's race and full of guilt,
Farewell all hope of that sex, whilst I thought,
There was one good, I feared to find one nought
But since there minds I all alike espy
Hence forth Isle choose as theirs, by mine eye,
Blessed be ye powers that gave such quick redress,
And for my labours sent so good success,
I rather choose though I a woman bee,
He should speak ill of all,
then dye for me.

To the Mountain topps is run,
Gilding all the vales below,
With his rising flames which grow,
Greater by his climbing still.
Up ye• lazy grooms and fill,
Bag and Bottle for the field,
Clasp your cloaks fast lest they yield,
To the bitter Northeast wind,
Call the Maidens up and find.
Who lay longest, that she may,
Go without a friend all day.
Then reward yonr dogs and pray,
Pan to keep you from decay,
So unfold, and then away
What not a Shepherd stirring sure the grooms,
Have found their bed• to easy, or the Rooms.
Filled with such new delight, and heat that they,
Have both forgot their hungry sheep, and day,
Knock that they may remember what a shame,
Sloth and neclect, lays on a Shepherds name.
It is to little purpose, not a swain,
This night hath known his lodging, here; or lain,
Within these cotes: the woods or some near town,
that is a neighbour to the bordering down:
Hath drawn them thither, bout some lusty sport;
Or spiced wassal Boule, to which resort.
All the young men and maids of many a coat,
Whilst the Trim, Minstrel strikes his merry note.
God pardon sin, show me the way that leads,
To any of their haunts.
This to the Meads.
And that down to the woods,
Then this for me,
Come Shepherd let me crave your company.
Now your thoughts are almost pure:
And your wound begins to cure.
Strive to banish all thats vain,
Lest it should break out again.
Eternal thanks to thee, thou holy maid:
I find my former wandering thoughts, well stayed,
Through thy •ise precepts, and my outward payne,
By thy choice herbs is almost gone again.
Thy sexes vice and virtue are reueald,
At once, for what one hurt another heald.
May thy grief more apease,
Relapses, are the worst disease:
Take heed how you in thought offend,
So mind and body both will mend.
Be thou the wildest creature of the Wood,
That bear me thus a way drowned in my blood.
And dying, know I cannot iniurd be
I am a maid, let that name fight for me:
Fairest Virgin do not fear,
Me that doth thy body bear,
Not to hurt, but held to be,
Men are ruder far then we.
See fair Goddess in the wood,
They have let out yet more blood:
Some savage man hath struck her breast
So soft and white, that no wild beast,
Durst a touched asleep or wake,
So sweet that Adder, Neut, or Snake.
Would have lain• from arm to arm,
On her Bosom to be warm,
All a night and being hot,
Gone away and stung her not.
Quickly clap herbs to her breast,
A man sure is a kind of Beast,
With spotless hand, on spotless Breast,
I put these herbs to give thee rest.
Which till it heal the there will bide
If both be pure, if no• of slide.
See it falls of from the wound,
Sepheardesse thou art not sound,
Fall of lust.
Who would have thought it,
So fair a face:
Why that hath brought it.
For ought I know or think, these words my last:
Yet Pan, so help me as my thoughts are chaste.
And so may Pan bless this my cure,
As all my thoughts are just and pure,
Some vncleanesse ny doth lurk,
That will not let my medcines work.
Satire search if thou can find it,
Here away me thinks I wind it.
Stronger yet, Oh here they be,
Here here in a hollow tree.
Two fond mortals have I found,
Bring them out they are unsound.
By the fingers thus I wring ye,
To my Goddess thus I bring ye.
Strife is vain come gently in,
I scented them, they are full of sin,
Hold Satire, take this Glass,
Sprinkle over all the place,
Purge the Ayre from lustful breath,
To save this Shepherdess frō death.
And stand you still, whilst I do dress
Her wound for fear the payne increase,
From this glass I throw a drop,
Of Crystal water on the top.
Of every grass on flowers a pair:
Send a fume and keep the Ayre,
Pure and wholesome, sweet &amp; blessed,
Till this virgins wound be dressed,
Satire help to bring her in,
By Pan, I think she hath no sin.
She is so light, lye on these leaves,
Sleep that mortal sense deceives.
Crown thine eyes, and ease thy pain,
May thou soon be well again,
Satire bring the Sheph•art ne'er,
Try him if his mind be clear,
Shepherd come,
My thoughts are pure,
The better trial to endure.
In this flame his figer thrust,
Which will burn him if he lust.
But if not away will turn,
As loath unspotted flesh to burn:
See it gives back let him go.
Farewell Mortal keep thee so.
Stay fair Nymph, fly not so fast,
Wee must try if yon be chaste:
Here is a hand that quaks for fear,
Sure she will not prove so clear:
Hold her finger to the flame:
That will yield her praise or shame.
To her doom she dares not stand,
But plucks away her tender hand:
And the Taper darting sends,
His hot beams at her fingers ends.
O thou art foul within, and hast;
A mind if nothing else unchaste.
Is not that Cloe? tic my love; tic she:
Cloe, fair Cloe.
My Alexis. Alexis: He.
Let me embrace thee.
Take her hence, Least her sight disturb his sense.
Take not her: take my life first.
See his wound again is burst,
Keep her near here in the wood.
Till I have stopped these streams of blood.
Soon again he ease shall find,
If I can but still his mind:
This curtain thus I do display,
To keep the pierceing Ayre away.
Sure they are lost for ever, tic in vain,
To find them out, with trouble and much pain:
That have a Ripe desire, and forward will,
To fly the company of all, but ill:
What shall be counsaild: Now shall we retire?
Or constant follow still, that first desire,
We had to find them?
Stay a little while:
For if the mornings mist do not beguile,
My sight with shadows: sure I see a swain
One of this jolly troops come back again.
Doest thou not blush young shepherd to be known,
Thus without care, leaving thy flocks alone:
And following what desire and present blood,
Shapes out before thy burning sense, for good,
Having forgot what tongue hereafter may
Tell to the world thy faleing off, and say
Thou art regardless both of good and shame,
Spurning at virtue, and a virtuous name:
And like a glorious desperate man, that buys,
A poison of much price, by which he dyes
Doest thou lay out for lust, whose only gain,
Is foul disease, with present age and pain:
And then a Grave: these be the fruit that grow,
In such hot veins that only beat to know,
Where they may take most ease &amp; grow ambtious,
Through their own wanton fire, and pride de•itious.
Right holy Sir I have not known this night,
What the smooth face of Mirth was: or the sight,
Of any looseness, music, joy and ease,
Have been to me, as bitter drugs to please
A Stomach lost with weakness, not a game
That I am skilled at throghly, nor a dame,
Went her tongue smoother then the feet of Time,
Her heavy ever living like the Rime,
Our blessed Tyterus did singe of yore,
No, were she more enticing then the store
Of fruitful Summr, when the laden tree,
Bids the faint Traveller be bold and free
It were but to me like Thunder against the bay,
Whose lightning may enclose, but never stay
Upon his charmed branches, such am I,
Against the catchiug flames of women's eye.
Then wherefore hast thou wandered.
It was a vow,
that drew me out last night, which I have now,
Strictly performed, and homewards go to give
fresh pasture to my sheep, that they may live.
Tic good to hear ye Sheeph art if the heart,
In this well sounding Music bear his part;
Where have you left the rest,
I have not seen,
Since yesternight, we met upon this greene,
To fouled our flocks up, any of that train
Yet have I walked these woods round and hauelaine
All this long night under an aged tree•
Yet neither wandering Shepherd did I see,
Or Shepherdess, or drew into mine ear,
The sound of living thing unless it were,
The Nightingale, among the thick leaved spring
That fits alone, in sorrow and doth sing:
Whole nights away in mourning, or the Owl,
Or our great Enemy that still doth howl.
Against the Moons cold beams.
Go and beware,
Of after falling.
Father tic my care.
Here comes another straggler, sure I see,
A shame in this young Shepherd Daphinis,
Hee,
Where hast left the rest, that should have been
Long before this, grazing upon the greene:
Their yet imprisoned flocks,
Thou holy man.
Give me a little breathing till I can,
Be able to unfold what I have seen,
Such horror that the like hath never been,
Known to the ear of Shepherd: oh my heart,
L•bours a double motion to impart,
So heavy tidings you all know the Bower,
Where the chaste Clorin, lives by whose great power,
Sick men and cattle hane been often cured,
There lovely Amoret, that was assured,
To lusty Perrigot: bleeds out her life:
Forced by some iron hand and fatal knife,
And by her young Alex•s.
If there be
Ever a Neighbour-brooke or hollow tree,
Receive my body, close me up from lust,
That follows at my heals, be ever just,
Thou God of shepherds: Pan for her dear sake,
That loves the Rivers brinks, and still doth shake,
In cold remenbrance of thy quick pursuit:
Let me be made a reed, and ever mute,
Nod to the waters fall, whilst every blast,
Singes through my slender leaves that I was chaste:
This is a night of wonder, Amarill,
Be Comforted, the holy gods are still,
Revengers of these wrongs.
Thou blessed man,
Honoured upon these plains and loved of Pan:
Hear me, and save from endless infamy,
My yet vnblasted flower Virginity
By all the Garlands that have croun'd that head,
By thy chaste office, and the marriage bed,
That still is blessed by thee: by all the rights
Due to our God: and by those virgin lights,
That burn before his Altar: let me not,
Fall from my former state to gain the blot
That never shall be purged.
I am not now,
That wanton Amarillis: here I vow,
To Heaven, and thee grave father, if I may,
Scope this unhappy Night, to know the day,
A virgin, never after to endure
The tongues, or company of men impure.
I hear him, come, save me.
Retire a while,
Behind this bushk, till wee have known that vile
Aboser of young maidens.
Stay thy pace,
Most loved Amarillis: let the chase,
grow calm and milder, fly me not so fast,
I fear the pointed Brambles have vnlac't
Thy golden Buskins, turn again and see:
Thy Shepherd follow, that is strong and free,
Able to give thee all cont•ned and case,
I am not bashful virgin, I can please:
At first encounter hug thee in mine arm,
And give thee many kisses, soft and warm,
As those the Sun prints on thy smiling cheek,
Of Plummes or mellow peaches I am sleek,
And smooth as Neptune when stern Eolus,
Lo•ks up his surely winds and nimbly thus,
Can show my Active youth why dost thou fly.
Remmber Amarillis it was I,
That kilt Alexis for thy sake, and set,
An everlasting hate twixt Amoret,
And her beloved Perigot it was I,
That drowned her in the well, where she must lye,
Till time shall leave to be, then turn again:
Tur•e with thy open arms and clipp the swain
That hath performed all this, turn turn I say:
I must not be deluded,
Monster stay,
Thou that art like a canker to the state,
Thou lives and brethest in, eating with debate,
Through every honest bosom, forcing still,
The veins of any men, may serve thy will.
Thou that hast offered with a sinful hand,
To seize upon this virgin that doth stand,
yet trembling here.
Good holiness declare,
What had the danger been if being bare,
I had imbracd her, tell me by your Art:
What coming wonders wood that fight impart.
Lust, and branded soul,
Yet tell me more,
Hath not our Mother Nature for her store,
And great increase, said it is good and just,
And willed that every living creature must,
Beget his like.
Ye are better read then I,
I must confess in Blood and Lechery:
Now to the Bower and bring this beast along,
Where he may suffer Penance for his wrong,
Here will I wash it in the mornings dew,
Which she on every little grass doth strew,
In silver drops ago•st the Suns appear:
Tic holy water and will make me clear.
My hand will not be cleansed, my wronged love,
If thy chaste spirit in the Ayre yet move,
Look mildly down on him that yet doth stand,
All •ull of guilt thy blood upon his hand,
And though I struck thee undeservedly,
Let my revenge on her that Iniurd thee.
Make less a fault which I intended not,
And let these dew drops wash away my spot,
It will not cle•nse, O to what sacred •loot,
Shall I resort to wash away this blood:
Amidst these Trees the holy Clorin. dwells,
In a low Cabin, of cut boughs and heales,
All wounds, to her I will my self a dress,
And my rash•faults repentantly confess:
Perhaps sheele find a means by Art or prayer,
To make my hand with chaste blood stained, fair
That done not far hence underneath some tree,
Isle ha•e a little Cabin built since she,
Whom I adored is dead, there will I give,
My self to stricknesse and like Clorin live.
Shepherd once more your bloold is stayed,
Take example by this maid,
Who is healed e•e you be pure,
so hard it is lewd lust to cure,
Take heed then how you turn your eye•
On these other lust fully,
And sheephear•esse take •eedleast you,
Move his willing eye thereto,
Let no wring, nor pinch, nor smile
Of yours, his weaker sense beguile,
Is your love yet true and chaste,
And for ever so to last.
I have forgot all vain desires,
All looser thoughts, ill temp•ed fires,
True love I find a pleasant •um,
Whose moderate heat can ne'er consume.
And I a new fire feel in me,
Whose base end is not quenched to be.
Join your hands with modest touch,
And for ever keep you such.
Yon is her cabin, thus far off isle stand,
And call her forth, for my unhallowed hand,
I dare not bring so near yo• sacerd place,
Clorin come forth and do a timely grace,
To a poor swain,
What art thou that doest call?
Clorin is ready to do good to all.
Come near.
I dare not.
Clorin. Satire, see
Who it is that calls on me.
Theirs a hand some swain doth stand,
Stretching out a bloody hand.
Come Clorin bring thy holy waters clear,
To wash my hand.
What w•nders have been here
To night stretch •oorth thy hand young swain,
Wash and •ubbe it whilst I rain
Holy water.
Still you power,
But my hand will never scour.
Satire• bring him to the bower
Wee will try the soueragne power
Of other waters.
Mo•tall su•e,
Tic the blood of maiden pure
That staines hee so.
What ever thou be.
Be thou her spright, or some divinity,
That in her shape thinks good to walk this grove,
Pardon poor Per•got
I am thy love.
Thy Amoret. for evermore thy love:
Stick once more on my naked breast, Isle prove
As constant still, O can thou love me yet,
How soon could I my former griefs forget.
So over great with joy, that you live now
I am, that no desire of knowing how
doth seize me; hast thou still power to forgive,
Whilst thou hast power to love, or I to live,
More welcome now then had thou never gone
A stray from me.
And when thou love alone
And not •, death or some lingering pain•
That's worse, light on me.
Now your stain
Perhaps will cleanse, thee once again
See the blood that erst did stay,
With the water drops away:
All the powers again are pleased,
And with this new knot are appeasd:
Join your hands, and rise together,
Pan be blessed that brought you hither.
Go back again what ere thou art: unless
Smooth maiden thoughts possess thee, doe not press
This hallowed ground, go Satire take his hand,
And give him present trial.
Mortal stand.
Till by fire, I have made known
Whether thou be such a one,
That may freely tread this place,
Hold thy hand up, never was,
More untainted flesh then this,
Fairest he is fall of bliss.
Then boldly speak why doest thou seek this place,
First honoured virgin to behold thy face,
Where all good dwells, that is, next for to try
The truth of late report, was given to me:
Those shepherds that have met with •whole mischance,
Through much neglect, and more ill governance,
Whether the wounds they have may yet endure
The open ayre, or stay a longer cure,
And lastly what the doom may be, shall light
Upon those guilty wretches, through whose spite
All this confusion full. For to this place,
Thou holy maiden have I brought the race,
Of these offenders, who have freely told,
Both why, and by what means, they gave this bold
Attempt upon their live.
Fume all the ground,
And sprinckle holy water, for unsound
And foul Infection gins to fill the Ayre
It gathers yet more strongly,
Of Censors filled with Franckensence and Mire.
Together with cold Camphor, quickly stir.
The gentle Satire, for the place begins
To sweat and labour, with the abhorred sins
Of those offenders, let them not come ny,
For full of itching flame and leprosy,
Their very souls are, that the ground goes back,
And shrinks to feel the •ullen weight of black
And so unheard of venom, hye thee fast,
Thou holy man, and banish from the chaste,
These manlike monsters, let them never more
Be known upon these dounes, but lunge before,
The next suns rising, put them from the sight,
And memory of every honest wight.
Be quick in expedition, lest the sores
Of these weak patients, break into new gores
My dear dear Amoret, how happy are,
Those blessed pairs, in whom a little l•rr
Hath bred an everlasting love, to strong
For time or steel, or envy to do wrong,
How do you feel your hurts, a lass poor heart
How much I was abused, give me the smart
For it is justly mine.
I doe believe.
It is enough dear friend, leave off to grieve,
And let vs once more in despite of ill,
Give hands, and hearts again
with better will,
Th•n ere I went to find, in hottest day
Cool Christ all of the fountain, to allay
My eager thirst, may this band never break,
Hear vs o heaven.
Be constant.
Else Pan wreak
With double vengeance, my disloyalty.
Let me not dare to know the company
Of men, or any more behold those eyes.
Thus shheepheare with a kiss all envy dies.
Bright Maid, I have performed your will, the swain
In whom such heate, and black rebellions reign
Hath undergone your sentence:
Only the maid I have reserved, whose face
shows much amendment, many a tear doth fall
In sorrow of her fault, great fair recall
Your heavy doom, in hope of better days
Which I dare promise: once again, vpraise
her heavy Spirit, that near drowned lies
In self cons•ming care that never dies.
I am content to pardon: call her in,
The ayre grows cool again, and doth begin
To purge it self, how bright the day doth show
After this stormy cloud, go Satire go,
And with this taper boldly try her hand.
If she be pure and good, and firmly stand
to be so still: we have perfoormd a work
worthy the gods them-selues 
Come forward Maiden, do not lurk
Nor hide your face with grief &amp; shame,
Now or never get a name,
That may raise thee, and recur,
All thy li•e that was impure,
Hold your hand unto the flame,
If thou be a perfect dame:
Or hast truly vowed to mend,
This pale fire will be thy friend.
See the Taper hurts her not,
Go thy ways let never spot,
Henceforth cease upon thy blood.
Thank the Gods and still be good.
Young shepherdess now, ye are brought again
To virgin state, be so, and so remain
To thy last day, unless the faithful love
Of some good shepherd force thee to remove,
Then labour to be true to him, and live
As such a one, that ever strives to give
A blessed memory to after Time:
Be famous for your good, not for your crime.
Now holy man, I offer up again
These patients full of health, and free from pain
Keep them, from after ills, be ever near
Unto their actions: teach them how to clear,
The tedious way they pass though, from suspect
Keep them from wrong in others, or neglect
Of duty in them selves, correct the blood,
With thrifty bitts and labour, let the flood,
Or the next neighbouring spring give remedy
To greedy thirst, and travail, not the tree
That hanges with wanton clusters, let not wine
•nlesse in sacrifice or rights divine,
Be ever known of shepherds, have a care,
Thou man of holy life, Now do not spare,
Their faults through much remissness, not forget,
To cherish him, whose many pains and sweat,
Hath given increase, and added to the downs.
Sort all your Shepherds from the lazy clowns:
That feed their heifers in the budded Brooms,
Teach the young maidens tricknes that ye grooms
May ever fear to tempt their blowing youth,
Banish all complement but single truth.
From every tongue, and every Shepherds heart,
Let them use persuading, but no Art:
Thus holy Priest, I wish to thee and these,
All the best goods and comforts that may please,
And all those blessings Heaven did ever give,
Wee pray upon this Bower may ever live.
Kneel every Shepherd, whilst with powerful hand,
I bless you after labours, and the Land.
You feed your flocks upon Great Pan defend you.
From misfortune and amend you,
Keep you from those dangers still,
That are followed by your will:
Give ye means to know at length,
All your Retches all your strenght.
Cannot keep your foot from falling,
To lewd lust, that still is calling,
At your cottage, till his power,
Bring again that golden hour:
Of peace and rest, to every soul.
May his care of you control,
All diseases, sores or payne,
That in after time may reign,
Either in your flocks or you,
Give ye all affections new.
New desires and tempers new,
That ye may be ever true.
Now rise and go, and as ye pass away,
Sing to the God of sheep, that happy lay:
That honest D•rus taught ye, Dorus hee,
That was the soul and God of melody.
 All ye Woods, and Trees, and Bowers,
All ye virtues, and ye powers:
That inhabit in the lakes,
In the pleasant springs or brakes.
Move your feet,
to our sound:
Whilst wee greet,
all this ground.
With his honour and his name.
That defends our flocks from blame.
Hee is great, and he is just,
Hee is ever good and must:
Thus be honoured, Daffodils,
Roses, Pinckes, and loved Lilies.
Let vs fling,
Whilst wee sing,
Ever holy,
Ever holy.
Ever honoured, ever young,
Thus great Pan is ever sung.
Thou divinest, fairest, brightest,
Thou most powerful maid, and whitest.
Thou most virtuous, and most blessed,
Eyes of Stars and Golden Tressed,
Like Apollo, tell me sweetest,
What new service now is meetest.
For thee Satire shall I stray,
In the middle Ayre and staye,
Thy Sailing Rack or nimbly take,
Hold by the Moon, and gently make.
Suite to the pale Queen of the night,
For a Beam to give thee light,
Shall I dive into the Sea,
And bring the corrall making way,
Through the rising waives that fall,
In snowy fleeces, dearest shall,
I catch the wanton fawns, or flies,
Whose woven wings the Summer dyes,
For many colours get thee fruit,
Or steal from Heaven old Orpheus Lute
All these I venture for and more,
To do her service, all these Woods adore
No other Service Satire but thy watch,
About these Thicks least harmless people catch,
Mischief or sad mischance.
Holy virgin, I will dance,
Round about these woods as quick,
As the breaking light, and prick,
Down the lawns, and down the vales,
Faster then the Windmill sails.
So I take my leave and pray,
All the comforts of the day:
Such as Phoebus heate doth send,
On the Earth may still be friend,
Thee and this Arbor.
And to thee,
All thy masters love be free.
The Pastoral of the faithful Shepherdess.
