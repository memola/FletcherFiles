HEalth to my Sovereign.
Eumenes, welcome:
Welcome to Paphos soldier to our love,
And that fair health ye wish us through the Camp
May it disperse it self, and make all happy;
How does the General, the valiant Memnon,
And how his wars, Eumenes?
The Gods have given you (royal Sir) a Soldier
Better ne'er sought a danger, more approved
In way of war, more master of his fortunes,
Expert in leading 'em; in doing valiant,
In following all his deeds to Victories,
And holding fortune certain there.
O Soldier,
Thou speak a man indeed; a General General,
A soul conceived a Soldier.
Ten set Battles
Against the strong usurper Diocles
Whom long experience had begot a Leader
Ambition raised too mighty: hath your Memnon
Won, and won gloriously, distressed and shook him
Even from the head of all his hopes to nothing:
In three he beat the thunder-bolt his brother
Forced him to wall himself up: there not safe,
Shook him with warlike Engines like an earthquake,
Till like a snail he left his shell and crawled
By night, and hideous darkness to destruction:
Disarmed for ever rising more; twelve Castles,
Some though impregnable; Towns twice as many
Countries that like the wind knew no command
But savage wildness; hath this General
With loss of blood &amp; youth, through storms &amp; tempests
Called to your fair obedience. 
O my Soldier
That thou were now within my arms; what drums 
Are those that beat Eumenes?
His my Sovereign;
Himself in the head of conquest drawing home,
An old man now to offer up his glories,
And endless conquest at your shrine,
Go all,
And entertain him with all Ceremony,
We'll keep him now a Courtier.
Sir, a strange one,
Pray God his language bear it; by my life, Sir
He knows no complement, nor curious casting
Of words into fit places ere he speak 'em,
He can say fight well fellow, and i'll thank thee:
He that must eat, must sweat; bring up the rear there,
Or charge that wing of horse home. 
Go too, go too. 
Valiant and wise are twins Sir: welcome, welcome,
Welcome my fortunate and famous General,
High in thy Princes favour as in fame,
Welcome to Peace and Paphos.
Thank your Grace,
And would to God my dull tongue had that sweetness
To thank you as I should; but pardon me,
My sword and I speak roughly Sir: your battles
I dare well say, I have fought well; for I bring ye
That lazy end you wish for Peace, so fully,
That no more name of war is: who now thinks
Sooner or safer these might have bin ended.
Begin 'em If ye dare again; I'll thank him.
Soldier and Soldiers Mate these twenty five years,
At length your General, (as one whose merit
Durst look upon no less,) I have waded through
Dangers would damp't these soft souls, but to hear of
The maidenheads of thousand lives hangs here Sir,
Since which time, Prince, I know no Court but Marshall,
No oily language, but the shock of Arms,
No dalliance but with death; No lofty measures
But weary and sad marches, cold and hunger,
Larums at midnight, Valours self would shake at,
Yet I ne'er shrunk. Balls of consuming Wildfire,
That licked men up like lightning, have I laughed at,
And tossed 'em back again like childrens trifles
Upon the edges of my Enemies swords
I have marched like whirle-windes, fury at this hand waiting,
Death at my right; Fortune my forlorn hope,
When I have grappled with destruction,
And tugged with pale faced Ruin, Night and Mischief,
Frighted to see a new day break in blood,
And every where I conquered; and for you sir,
Mothers have wanted wombs to make me famous,
And blown ambition dangers; Those that grieved ye,
I have taken order for in the earth: those fools
That shall hereafter.
No more wars my soldier: 
We must now treat of peace sir.
How he talks,
How gloriously.
A goodly timbered fellow,
Valiant no doubt.
If valour dwell in vaunting;
In what a phrase he speaks as if his actions
Could be set of in nothing but a noise,
Sure has a drum in's mouth.
I wonder wenches
How he would speak to us.
Nothing but larum
Tell us whose throat he cut, show us his sword,
And bless it for sure biting.
And t like your Grace,
I doe not think he knows us what we are,
Or to what end; for I have heard his followers
Affirm he never saw a woman that exceeded
A Sutlers wife yet, or in execution
Old bedrid Beldams without teeth or tongues,
That would not fly his fury? how he looks.
This way devoutly.
Sure his Lordship's viewing
Our Fortifications.
If he mount at me,
I may chance choke his Battery.
Still his eye
Keeps quarter this way: ??enus grant his valour
Be not in love.
If he be, presently
Expect a Herald and a Trumpet with ye
To bid ye render; we two Perdu's pay for it else.
I'll leave ye to my sister, and these Ladies
To make your welcome fuller: my good soldier
We must now turn your sternness into Courtship
When ye have done there; to your fair repose sir: 
I know you need it Memnon, welcome gentlemen. 
Now he begins to march: Madam the Van's yours,
Keep your ground sure; it is for your spurs.
O Venus. 
How he stares on me.
Knight him Madam, knight him
He will grow tooth' ground else.
Speak sir, it is the Princess.
Ye shame your self, speak to her
Rise and speak sir.
Ye are welcome to the Court, to me, to all sir,
Is he not deaf?
The Gentleman's not well.
Fie noble General,
Give him fresh air his colour goes, how do ye?
The Princess will be glad sir.
Peace, and hear me.
Command a silence there.
I love thee Lady.
I thank your Lordship heartily: proceed sir.
Lord how it stuck in's stomach like a surfeit.
It breaks apace now from him, God be thanked,
What a fine spoken man he is.
A choice one of singular variety in carriage.
Yes and I warrant you he knows his distance.
With all my heart I love thee.
A hearty gentleman,
And I were even an arrand beast, my Lord,
But I loved you again.
Good Lady kiss me.
I marry, Mars, there thou came close up to her.
Kiss you at first my Lord, it is no fair fashion,
Our lips are like Rose buds, blown with men's breaths,
They loose both sap and savour; there's my hand sir.
Fie, fie, my Lord, this is too rude.
Unhand me,
Consume me if I hurt her; good sweet Lady
Let me but look upon thee.
Doe.
Yet.
Well sir.
Take your full view.
Bless your eyes sir.
Mercy,
Is this the man they talked of for a soldier,
So absolute and Excellent: O the Gods,
If I were given to that vanity
Of making sport with men for ignorance,
What a most precious subject had I purchased?
Speak for him gentlemen: some one that knows,
What the man ails; and can speak sense.
Sure Madam,
This fellow has been a rare Hare finder
See how his eyes are set.
Some one go with me,
I'll send him something, for his head, poor gentleman,
Is troubled with the staggers.
Keep him dark,
He will run March mad else, the fumes of Battell's
Ascend into his brains,
Clap to his feet
An old Drum head, to draw the thunder downward.
Look to him gentlemen: farewell, Lord I am sorry
We cannot kiss at this time, but believe it
We'll find an hour for all: God keep my children,
From being such sweet Soldiers; Softly wenches,
Lest we disturb his dream. 
Why this is Monstrous.
A strange forgetfulness, yet still he holds it.
Though he ne'er saw a woman of great fashion
Before this day, yet my thinks it is possible
He might imagine what they are, and what
Belongs unto 'em; mere ???eport of others.
Pish, his head had other whimsies in it: my Lord,
Death I think you're struck dumb; my good Lord General
Sir.
That I doe love ye Madam; and so love ye
An't like your grace.
He has bin studying this speech.
Who doe ye speak to sir.
Why whore's the Lady
The woman, the fair woman.
Who?
The Princess,
Give me the Princess.
Give ye counsel rather
To use her like a Princess: Fie my Lord,
How have you borne your self, how nakedly
Laid your soul open: and your ignorance
To be a sport to all; report and honour;
Drew her to doe you favours, and you bluntly,
Without consideration what, or how she was
Neither collecting reason, nor distinction.
Why, what did I my masters?
All that shows
A man unhandsome, undigested done.
Did not I kneel unto her?
Dumb and senseless,
As though ye had bin cut out for your fathers tomb,
Or stuck a land-marke; when she spoke unto you,
Being the excellence of all our Island,
Ye stared upon her, as ye had seen a monster
Was I so foolish; I confess Eumenes,
I never saw before so brave an outside
But did I kneel so long
Till they laughed at ye,
And when you spoke, I am ashamed to tell ye
What it was my Lord; how far from order;
Bless me, is it possible the wild noise of a war
And what she only teaches should possess ye,
Knowledge to treat with her, and full discretion
Being at flood still in ye, and in peace,
And manly conversation smooth and civil,
Where gracefulness and glory twyn together
Thrust your self out an exile?
Doe you know sir, what state she carries?
What great obedience waits at her back continually?
She ne'er commanded
A hundred thousand men, as I have done,
Nor ne'er won battle; Say I would have kissed her.
There was a dainty offer too, a rare one.
Why, she is a woman, is she not?
She is so.
Why, very well; what was she made for then?
Is she not young and handsome bred to breed?
Doe not men kiss fair women? if they doe,
If lips be not unlawful ware; Why a Princess
Is got the same way that we get a beggar,
Or I am cozened; and the selfsame way
She must be handled ever she get another,
That's rudeness is it not?
To her it is held so, &amp; rudeness in that high degree.
It is reason,
But I will be more punctual; pray what thought she?
Her thoughts were merciful, but she laughed at ye,
Pitying the poorness of your complement,
And so she left ye, good sir shape your self
To understand the place, and noble persons
You live with now.
Let not those great deserts
The King hath laid up of ye, and the people,
Be blasted with ill bearing.
The whole name of soldier, then will suffer,
Shoe's a sweet one.
And good sirs leave your exhortations
They come untimely to me, I have brains
That beat above your reaches: Shoe's a Princess,
That's all: I have killed a King, that's greater.
Come let's to dinner, if the Wine be good,
You shall perceive strange wisdom in my blood.
Well, would thou were in the wars again
Old Memnon, there thou would talk to the purpose,
And the proudest of all these Court Chameleons
Would be glad to find it sense too: plague of this
Dead peace, this bastard breeding lousy lazy idleness,
Now we must learn to pipe, and pick our livings
Out of old rotten ends: these twenty five years
I have served my Country, lost my youth and blood,
Exposed my life to dangers more then days.
Yet let me tell my wants, I know their answers,
The King is bound to right me, they good people
Have but from hand to mouth, look to your wives
Your young trim wives, your high-day wives, your march-paines,
For if the soldiers find not recompense,
As yet there's none a hatching; I believe
You men of wars, the men of wars will nick ye,
For starve nor beg they must not, my small means
Are gone in fumo: here to raise a better
Unless it be with lying, or dog flattering,
At which our Nations excellent; observing dog-dayes,
When this good Lady broils, and would be basted
By that good Lord or such like moral learnings,
Is here impossible; Well, I will rub among 'em
If any thing for honesty be gotten,
Thou't be but bread and cheese I can be satisfied,
If otherwise the wind blow, stiff as I am
Yet I shall learn to shuffle: There's an old Lass
That shall be nameless yet alive, my last hope,
Has often got me my pocket full of crowns
If all fail, jackdaws, are you alive still?
Then I see the coast clear, when fools and boys can prosper.
Brave Lieutenant
Hail to the man of worship.
You are fine sirs,
Most passing fine at all points.
As ye see sir,
Home-bred and handsome, we cut not out our clothes sir
At half sword as your Taylors doe, and pink 'em
With Pikes and Partisans, we live retired sir
Gentlemen like, and jealous of our honours.
Very fine Fool, and fine Boy, Peace plays with you
As the wind plays with feathers, dances ye
You grind with all gusts gallants.
We can bounce sir,
When you Soldados bend in the hams, and frisk too.
When twenty of your trip-coats turn their tip???pets,
And your cold sallets without salt or vinegar
By rambling in your stomachs, hemp and hobnails
Will bear no price now, hanging and old harness
Are like to over-run us.
Whores and hot houses.
Surgeons and Sirenges ring out your sance-bells.
Your Jubilee, your Jubilee.
Proh Deum.
How our St. Georges will bestride the Dragons
The red and romping Dragons.
Advanced fool.
But then the sting in the tail boy.
Tanto melior.
For so much the more danger, the more honour.
You're very pleasant with our occupation Gent.
Which very like amongst these fiery Serpents
May light upon a Blind-worme of your blood,
A Mother or a Sister.
Mine's past saddle
You should be sure of her else: but say Sir Huon
Now the Drums doubbes, &amp; the sticks turned bed-staves,
All the old Foxes hunted to their holes,
The Iron age returned to Eribus,
And Honorificabilitudinitatibus
Thrust out of the Kingdom by the head and shoulders,
What trade doe you mean to follow.
That's a question.
Yes and a learned question if ye mark it,
Consider and say on.
Fooling as thou dost, that's the best trade I take it.
Take it strait then
For fear your fellows be before ye, hark ye Lieutenant
Foolings the thing, the thing worth all your fightings,
When ell's done ye must fool sir.
Well, I must then.
But doe you know what fooling is; true fooling
The circumstances that belong unto it,
For every idle knave that shows his teeth
Wants and would live can Juggle tumble, fiddle,
Make a dog face, or can abuse his fellow,
Is not a fool at first dash, you shall find sir
Strange turnings in this trade; to fool is nothing
As fooling has bin but to fool the fair way,
The new way, as the best men fool their friends,
For all men get by fooling merely fooling,
Desert does nothing valiant, wise, virtuous,
Are things that walk by without bread or breeches,
I partly credit that.
Fine wits, fine wits sir,
There's the young Boy, he does well in his way too,
He could not live else in his Masters absence;
He ties a Ladies garters so, so, prettily,
Say his hand slip, but say so.
Why let it slip then.
It is ten to one the body shall come after,
And he that works deserves his wages.
That's true.
Hee riddles finely to a waiting Gentlewoman
Expounds dreams like a Prophet, dreams himself too,
And wishes all dreams true; they cry Amen,
And there's a Memorandum: he can sing too
Bawdy enough to please old Ladies: he lies rarely,
Pawns ye a suit of clothes at all points, fully,
Can pick a pocket if ye please, or casket;
Lisps when he lists to catch a Chambermaid,
And calls his Hostess mother, these are things now,
If a man mean to live, to fight and swagger,
Beaten about the Ears with bawling sheepskins,
Cut to the soul for Summer: here an arm lost,
And there a leg; his honourable head
Sealed up in salves and searclothes, like a packet,
And so sent over to an Hospital, stand there, charge there,
Swear there, whore there, dead there,
And all this sport for cheese, and chines of dog-flesh,
And money when two Wednesdays meet together,
Where to be lousy is a Gentleman,
And he that wears a clean shirt has his
Shroud on.
I'll be your scholar, come if I like fooling.
You cannot choose but like it, fight you one day
I'll fool another, when your Surgeons paid,
And all your leaks stopped, see whose slops are heaviest,
I'll have a shilling for a can of wine,
When you shall have two Sergeants for a counter.
Come learn of us Lieutenant, hang your Iron up,
We'll find you cooler wars.
Come let's together,
I'll see your tricks, and as I like 'em. ??? 
Why was there not such women in the camp then
Prepared to make me know 'em.
It was no place sir.
Why should they live in Tumults: they are cry???tures
Soft and of sober natures.
Could not your wives,
Your mothers, or your sisters have been sent for
To exercise upon.
We thank your Lordship.
But doe you mean?
I doe mean.
What sir?
To see her,
And see thee hanged too, and thou anger'st me,
And thousands of your throats cut, get ye from me
Ye keep a prating of your points of manners,
And fill my head with lousy circumstances,
Better have Ballets in 't your courtly worships,
How to put off my hat, you how to turn me,
And you forsooth to blow my nose discreetly;
Let me alone, for I will love her, see her,
Talk to her, and mine own way.
Shoe's the Princess.
Why let her be the devil, I have spoke,
When Thunder durst not check me, I must love,
I know she was a thing kept for me.
And I know sir,
Though she were born yours, yet your strange behaviour
And want.
Thou least.
I doe not.
Ha!
I doe not lye sir,
I say you want fair language, nay it is certain
You cannot say good morrow.
Ye Dog-whelpes,
The proudest of your prating tongues.
Doe kill us,
Kill us for telling truth, for my part General
I would not live to see men make a may-game
Of him I have made a Master, kill us quickly,
Then ye may.
What?
Doe what you list, draw your sword childishly
Upon your servants that are bound to tell ye
I am weary of my life.
And I.
And all sir.
Go to the Princess make her sport, cry to her
I am the glorious man of war.
Pray ye leave me,
I am sorry I was angry, I'll think better,
Pray no more words.
Good sir.
Nay then.
We are gone sir. 
How came he hither, see for heavens sake wenches,
What faces, and what postures he puts on, 
I doe not think he is perfect.
If your love
Have not betrayed his little wits, he's well enough.
As well as he will be.
Mark how he Muses.
Has a Battalion now in's brains, he draws out now
Have at ye Harpers.
See, see, there the fire fails.
Look what an Alphabet of faces he runs through,
O love, love, how amorously thou look
In an old rusty armour.
I'll away, for by my troth I fear him.
Fear the gods Madam,
And never care what man can doe, this fellow
Withal his frights about him and his furies,
His larums and his Lances, Swords and Targets,
Nay case him up in armour Cap-a-pe,
Yet durst I undertake within two hours,
If he durst charge to give him such a shake
Should shake his valour off, and make his shanks too
For shame no more.
Hee muses still.
The Devil.
Why should this old dried timber chopped with thunder.
Old wood burns quickest.
Out you would say Madam,
Give me a green stick that may hold me heat
And smoke me soundly too: a turns, and sees ye.
There's no avoiding now, have at ye. 
Lady,
The more I look upon ye. 
The more you may sir.
Let him alone.
I would desire your patience
The more I say I look, the more 
My Fortune
It is very apt Sir
Women let my fortune
And me alone I wish ye, pray come this way
And stand you still there Lady
Leave the words Sir, and leap into the meaning
Then again.
I tell you I doe love ye
Why
No questions: pray no more questions.
I doe love you. Infinitely, why doe you smile.
Am I ridiculous
I am monstrous fearful, no I joy you love me
Joy on then and be proud on it, I doe love ye,
Stand still doe not trouble me you Women.
He loves you Lady at whose feet has kneeled
Princes to beg their freedoms, he whose valour
Has over run whole Kingdoms
That makes me doubt Sir
Twill over run me to
He whose Sword
Talk not so big Sir, you will fright the Princess.
Ha. Lucip. No forsooth
I know ye have done wonders.
I have and will doe more and greater braver.
And for your beauty miracles, name that kingdom
And talk your choice:
Sir I am not ambitious
Ye shall be, it is the child of glory: she that I love
Whom my desires shall magnify time stories
And all the Empire of the Earth:
I would fine ask him.
Prithee be quiet, he will beat us both else.
What will ye make me then Sir
I will make thee
Stand still and hold thy peace, I have a heart Lady
Ye were a monster else
A loving heart
A truly loving heart:
Alas how came it
I would you had it in your hand sweet Lady
To see the truth it bears ye:
Doe you give it.
That was well thought upon:
Twill put him too't wench;
And you shall see I dare accept it Sir
Tak't in my hand and view it: if I find it
A loving and a sweet heart as you call it
I am bound, I am
No more Isle send it to ye
As I have honour in me you shall have it
Handsomely done Sir, and perfumed by all means
The weathers warm Sir
With all circumstance
A napkin wrought most curiously;
Divinely
Put in a goblet of pure gold
Yes in Iacynth
That she may see the spirits through
Ye have greased him
For chewing love again in hast
If he should doe it
If Heaven should fall we should have larks, he doe
See how he thinks upon it
He will think these three years
Ere he prove such an ass, I liked his offer
There was no other way to put him of else.
I will doe it
Lady expect my heart
I doe Sir:
Love it and so I leave ye. 
Either he is stark mad
Or else I think he means it
He must be stark mad
Or he will never doe it, it is vain glory
And want of judgement that provokes this in him
Sleep and society cures all his heart
No no good Gentleman ther's more belongs too't
Hearts are at higher prizes, lets go in
And there examine him a little better.
Shut all the doors behind for fear he follow
I hope I have lost a lover, and am glad on it. 
It is but to die, dogs doe it, ducks with d???bling,
Birds sing away their souls, and babies sleep 'em,
Why doe I talk of that is treble vantage,
For in the other world she is bound to have me,
Her Princely word is past: my great desert too
Will draw her to come after presently
It is justice, and the gods must see it done too
Besides no Brother, Father, kindred there
Can hinder us, all languages are a like ???oo
There love is everlasting, ever young
Free from diseases, ages, jealousies.
Bawds, beldams, painters, purgers, die, it is nothing
Men drown themselves for joy to draw in Juleps
When they are hot with wine, In dreams we doe it,
And many a handsome wench that loves the sport well
Gives up her soul so in her lovers bosom,
But I must be incisde first, cut and opened
My heart and handsomely taine from me, stay there
Dead once stay, let me think again, who doe I know there
For else to wander up and down unwaited on
And unregarded in my place and project
Is for a sowters soul, not an old Soldiers.
My brave old Regiments: I there it goes
That have bin killed before me, right,
Is here, and I must trouble him.
Then those I have conquered
To make my train full:
Sir
My Captains then:
Sir I beseech ye
For to meet her there
Being a Princess and a Kings sole Sister
With great accommodation must be cared for
Weigh but the Soldiers poverty
Mine own troop first
For they shall die:
How whats this
Next:
Shall I speak louder Sir
A square Battalion:
You doe not think of us.
Their Armours gilded:
Good noble Sir
And round about such Engines
Shall make hell shake:
Ye doe not mock me
For Sir
I will be strange as brave
Ye may consider
You know we have served you long enough
No Soldier
That ever landed on the blessed Elizium
Did or shall march, as I will
Would ye would march Sir
Up to the King and get us
King nor Kaiser
Shall equal me in that world
What a devil ails he
Next the rare beauties of those towns I fired
I speak of money Sir:
Ten thousand Coaches
O pounds Sir, pounds I beseech your Lordship
Let Coaches run out of your remembrance
In which the wanton Cupids; and the graces
Drawn with the Western winds kindling desires,
And then our Poets.
Then our pay
For Chilax when the triumph comes; the Princess
Then for I will have a Heaven made
Bless your Lordship I
Stand still Sir
So I doe and in it
Death Sir
You talk you know not what
Such rare devises:
Make me I say a Heaven
I say so too Sir
For here shall run a Constellation
And there a pissing Conduit
Ha!
With wine Sir
A Sun there in his hight, there such a planet
But wher's our money where runs that
Ha?
Money
Money ant like your Lordship
Why all the carriage, shall come behind the stuff
Rich hangings, treasure
Or say we have none
I may say so truly
For hang me if I have a great: I have served well
And like an honest man: I see no reason
Thou must needs die good Chilax
Very well Sir
I will have honest, valiant souls about me
I cannot miss thee
Dye?
Yes die, and Pelius
Eumenes and Polibius: I shall think
Of more within these two hours
Die Sir?
I Sir
And ye shall die
When I beseech your Lordship
To morrow see ye doe die
A short warning,
Troth Sir I am ill prepared
I die my self then
Beside ther's reason
Oh!
I pray thee tell me
For thou art a great dreamer
I can dream Sir
If I eat well and sleep well
Was it never
By dream or apparition opened to thee?
Hes mad
What the other world was, or Elizium?
Did never travel in thy sleep?
To Taverns
When I was drunk ore night: or to a wench
Ther's an Elizium for ye, a young Lady
Wrapped round about ye like a snake: is that it?
Or if that strange Elizium that you talk of
Be where the Devil is, I have dream't of him
And that I have had him by the horns, and rid him
He trots the Dagger out 'oth sheath
Elizium,
The blessed fields, man
I know no fields blessed, but those I have gained by
I have dreamt I have bin in Heaven too
There, handle that place; that's Elizium
Brave singing, and brave dancing
And rare things
All full of flowers
And Pot herbs
Bowers for lovers
And everlasting ages of delight
I slept not so far
Meet me on those banks
Some two days hence
In dream Sir
No in death Sir
And there I muster all, and pay the Soldier
Away, no more, no more
God keep your Lordship
This is fine dancing for us
Wher's the General
Ther's the old sign of Memnon, where the soul is
You may go look as I have
What's the matter
Why question him and see; he talks of Devils
Hells, Heavens, Princes, powers, and Potentates,
You must to'th pot too
How?
Do you know Elizium a tale he talks the wild goose chase of
Elizium? I have red of such a place.
Then get he to him
Ye are as fine company as can be fitted. 
Your worships fairly met
Mercy upon us,
What ails this Gentleman?
Provision
How his head works.
Between two ribs
If he cut short or mangle me; Isle take him
And twirl his neck about
Now Gods defend us
In a pure cup transparent with a writing
To signify
I never knew him thus
Sure is bewitched, or poisoned;
Whose there
I Sir
Come hither Siphax
Yes; how does your Lordship
Well God a mercy Soldier, very well
But prithee tell me
Any thing I can Sir
What durst thou doe to gain the rarest beauty
The World has
That the world has? it is worth doing
Is it so? but what doing bears it?
Why any thing, all dangers it appears to
Name some of those things; doe
I would undertake Sir
A voyage round about the World
Short Siphax,
A merchant does it to spice pots of ale
I wooed swim in armour
Short still: a poor Jade
Laden will take a stream and stem it strongly
To leap a Mare
The plague I durst
Still shorter
Isle cure it with an Onion
Surfeits
Short still
They are often Physics for our healths and help us.
I wooed stand a breach
Thine honour bids thee Soldier
It is shame to find a second cause
I durst Sir
Fight with the fellest Monster
That s the poorest,
Man was ordained their Master; durst ye die Sir?
How? die my Lord!
Die Siphax: take thy sword
And come by that door to her; ther's a prize
To buy a lusty love at
I am well content Sir
To prove no purchaser
Away thou world worm,
Thou win a matchless beauty?
It is to loos't Sir
For being dead wher's the reward I reach at,
The love I labour for?
There it begins fool
Thou art merely consent; for the loves wee now know
Are but the heats of half an hour; and hated
Desires stirred up by nature to increase her
Licking of one another to a lust;
Course and base appetites earths mere inheritors
And heirs of Idleness and blood; Pure Love
That that the soul affects and cannot purchase
While she is laden with our flesh, that love Sir
Which is the price of honour dwells not here,
Your Ladies eyes are lamplesse to that virtue,
That beauty smiles not on a cheek washed over,
Nor scents the sweets of Embers; below, Siphax
Below us, in the other Word, Elizium,
VVher's no more dying, no despairing, mourning,
Where all desires are full, deserts down laden,
There Siphax, there, where loves are ever living,
Why doe we love in this World then?
To preserve it,
The maker lost his work else: but mark Siphax,
What issues that love bears.
Why Children Sir;
I never heard him talk thus; thus divinely
And sensible before
It does so, Siphax,
Things like our selves, as sensual vain unvented
Bubles and breath of airs, got with an itching
As blisters are; and bred, as much corruption
Flows from their lives, sorrow conceives and shapes 'em
And oftentimes the deaths of those we love most
The breeders bring them to the World to curse 'em,
Crying they weep amongst us like young Cats,
Cares and continual crosses keeping with 'em,
They make time old to tend them and experience
An ass they alter so; they grow and goodly
Here we can turn our thoughts, like drops of water
They fall into the maine, and known no more;
This is the love of this world: I must tell thee
For thou art understanding
What you please Sir
And as a faithful man
Nay I dare trust thee
I love the Princess
There it is that has fired him
I knew he had some inspiration
But does she know it Sir?
Yes marry does she
I have given my heart unto her
If ye love her
Nay understand me, my heart taken from me
Out of my body man and so brought to her
How lik'st thou that brave offer? ther's the love
I told thee of; and after death the living;
She must in justice, come boy, ha?
Your heart Sir?
I, so by all means Siphax
He loves roast well
That eats the spit
And since thou art come thus fitly
Isle doe it presently and thou shall carry it
For thou can tell a story and describe it
And I conjure thee Siphax by thy gentry
Next by the glorious battles we have fought in
By all the dangers, wounds, heats, colds, distresses,
Thy love next and obedience, nay thy life
But one thing first Sir, if she pleased to grant it
Could ye not love her here and live, consider
Ha? yes I think I could
'Twoul'd be far nearer
Besides the sweets here, would induce the last love
And link it in
Thou say right, but our ranks here
And bloods are bars between us, she must stand off too
As I perceive she does
Desert and duty
Makes even all Sir
Then the King, though I
Have merited as much as man can; must not let her,
So many Princes covetous of beauty;
I wooed with all my heart but it is impossible
Why say she marry after
No she dare not
The Gods dare not doe ill: come
Doe you mean it
Lend me thy knife, and help me of
For heaven sake
Be not so stupid mad dear General.
Dispatch, I say.
As ye love that ye look for
Heaven and the blessed life.
Hell take thee Coxcomb,
Why dost thou keep me from it; thy knife, I say.
Doe but this one thing, on my knees I beg it,
Stay but two hours till I return again,
For I will to her, tell her all your merits,
Your most unvalued love, and last your danger;
If she relent, then live still, and live loving,
Happy, and high in favour: if she frown;
Shall I be sure to know it.
As I live Sir,
My quick return shall either bring ye fortune,
Or leave you to your own fate.
Two hours?
Yes, Sir.
Let it be kept, away, I will expect it. 
You dainty wits two, an ye to a Cater,
To cheat him of a dinner.
Ten at Court sir
Are few enough, they are as wise as we are.
Hang ye, I'll eat at any time: and any where
I never make that part of want, preach to me
What ye can doe, and when ye list.
Your patience,
It is a hard day at Court, a fish day.
So it seems sir,
The finns grow out of thy face.
And to purchase
This day the company of one dear Custard,
Or a mess of Rice ap Thomas, needs a maine wit;
Beef we can bear before us lined with Brews
And tubs of Pork; vociferating Veales,
And tongues that ne'er told lye yet.
Line thy mouth with 'em
Thou hast need, and great need,
For these finny fish-dayes,
The Officers understandings are so phlegmatic,
They cannot apprehend us.
That's great pity,
For you deserve it, and being apprehended
The whip to boot; Boy what doe you so near me,
I dare not trust your touch boy.
As I am virtuous
What, thieves among our selves?
Stremon.
Lieutenant.
Welcome ashore, ashore.
What Monsieur, Music?
My fine Fool.
Fellow Crack, why what a consort
Are we now blessed withal?
Fooling and fiddling
Nay and we live not now boys; what new songs sir.
A thousand man, a thousand.
Itching airs
Alluding to the old sport.
Of all sizes.
And how does small Tym Treble here; the heart on it.
To doe you service.
O Tym the times, the times Tym.
How does the General,
And next what moneys stirring?
For the General
Is here, but such a General
The times changed Stremon,
He was the liberal General, and the loving,
The feeder of a Soldier, and the father,
But now become the stupid'st.
Why, what ails he.
Nay, if a horse knew, and his head's big enough
I'll hang for it; did thou ever see a dog
Run mad of the tooth-ache, such another toy
Is he now so, a gloats and grins, and bites.
Why hang him quickly,
And then he cannot hurt folks.
One hour raving,
Another smiling, not a word the third hour,
I tell thee Stremon has a stirring soul,
What ever it attempts or labours at
Would wear out twenty bodies in another.
I'll keep it out of me, for mine's but buckeram,
Hee would bounce that out in two hours.
Then he talks
The strangest and the maddest stuff from reason,
Or any thing ye offer; stand thou there,
I'll show thee how he is, for I'll play Memnon
The strangest General that ere thou heard of Stremon.
My Lord.
Go presently and find me
A black horse with a blew tail; bid the blank Cornet
Charge through the Sea, and sink the Navy: softly,
Our souls are things not to be wakened in us
With larums, and loud bawlings, for in Elizium
Stillness and quietness, and sweetness, sir,
I will have, for it much concerns mine honour,
Such a strong reputation for my welcome
As all the world shall say: for in the forefront
So many on white Unicorns, next them
My gentlemen, my Cavaliers and Captains,
Ten deep and trapt with tenter-hookes to take hold
Of all occasions: for Friday cannot fish out
The end I aim at; tell me of Diocles,
And what he dare doe, dare he meet me naked
Thunder in this hand, in his left? Fool?
Yes Sir.
Fool, I would have thee fly in the ayre fly swiftly
To that place where the Sun sets, there deliver.
Deliver? what sir?
This sir, this ye slave sir, 
Death ye rude rogues, ye Scarrubbs.
Hold for Heavens sake Lieutenant, sweet Lieutenant???nant.
I have done sir.
You have wrung his neck off.
No Boy, it is the nature
Of this strange passion when't hits to hale people
Along by th'haire, to kick 'em, break their heads:
Do ye call this Acting, was your part to beat me.
Yes, I must act all that he does.
Plague act ye,
I'll act no more.
It is but to show man.
Then man
Hee should have showed it only, and not done it,
I am sure he beat me beyond Action,
Gowts a your heavy fist.
Isle have thee to him,
Thou hast a fine wit, fine fool, and can play rarely.
Heal hug thee, boy, and stroke thee,
Isle to the stocks first,
Here I be stroked thus.
But how came he Chilax?
I know not that,
Isle to him
He loves thee well,
And much delights to here thee sing; much taken
He has bin with thy battle songs.
If Musique,
Can find his madness; isle so fiddle a him,
That out it shall by the shoulders,
My fine fiddler,
Heal firk you and ye take not heed too: t'will be rare sport
To see his own trade triumph over him;
His Lute laced to his head, for creeping hedges;
For money ther's none stirring; try good Stremon
Now what your silver sound can doe; our voices
Are but vain Echoes,
Something shall be done
Shall make him understand all; lets to'th Tavern,
I have some few Crowns left yet: my whistle wet once
Isle pipe him such a Paven -
Hold thy head up,
Ie cure it with a quart of wine; Come Coxcomb;
Come boy take heed of napkins.
Youl'd no more acting?
No more Chicken;
Go then.
God save you sir; pray how might I see the Princess
Why very fitly sir shees even now ready,
To wa ke out this way into'th park; stand there,
Ye cannot miss her sight, sir,
I much thank ye.
Lets have a care, for isle assure ye wenches
I woo d not meet him willingly again;
For though I doe not fear him, yet his fashion
I wood not be acquainted much wit'h.
Gentle Lady,
Ye need not fear the walks are viewed and empty,
But my thinks Madam this kind heart of his ???
Is slow a coming.
Keep me ye blessed Angels,
What killing power is this?
Why dost thou look for it?
Dost think he spoke in earnest?
My thinks Madam,
A Gentleman should keep his word; and to a Lady
A Lady of your excellencies;
Out fool!
Send me his heart? what should we doe wo't? dance it?
Dry it and drink it for the worms.
Whose that?
What man stands there?
Where?
There.
A Gentleman,
Which I beseech your grace to honour so much,
As know him for your servants brother.
Siphax?
The same an't please your grace; what does he here?
Upon what business and I ignorant?
Hoe's grown a handsome Gentleman; good Siphax
Yat wel-come from the wars; wooed ye with us sir?
Pray speak your will: a blushes, be not fearefu l,
I can assure ye for your Sisters sake sir,
Ther's my hand on it.
Doe you hear Sir?
Sure these Soldiers,
Are all grown senseless,
Doe ye know where ye are sir?
Tongue-tied,
He looks not well too, by my life, I think;
Speak, for shame speak.
A man wooed speak ???
These Soldiers,
Are all dumb Saints: Consider and take time sir,
Lets forward wenches come, his palates down.
Dare these men charge it'h face of fire and bullets?
And hang there heads down at a handsome Woman?
Good master Mars that 's a soul fault.
Fie beast,
No more my brother.
Sister, honoured Sister,
Dishonoured fool,
I doe confess,
Fie on thee,
But stay till I deliver,
Let me go,
I am a shame to own thee,
Fare ye well then,
Ye must ne'er see me more,
Why stay dear Siphax,
My angers past; I will hear ye speak
O Sister,
Out with it Man,
O I have drunk my mischief,
Ha? what?
My destruction.
In at mine eyes I have drunk it; O the Princess,
The rare sweet Princess!
How fool? the rare Princess?
Was it the Princess that thou sed'st?
The Princess,
Thou doest not love her sure, thou dare not.
Yes by heaven,
Yes by Heaven? I know thou dare not,
The Princess? it is thy life the knowledge of it,
Presumption that will draw into it all thy kindred,
And leave 'em slaves and succourless; the Princess?
Why shoe's a sacred thing to see and worship,
Fixed from us as the Sun is high and glorious,
To be adored not doted on; desire things possible,
Thou foolish young man, nourish not a hope,
Will hail thy heart out.
It is my destiny,
And I know both disgrace and death will quit it,
If it be known
Pursue it not then Syphax
Get thee good wholesome thoughts may nourish thee.
Go home and pray
I cannot
Sleep then Syphax.
And dream away thy doting.
I must have her
Or you no more your brother; work Cleant he,
Work, and work speedily, or I shall die wench.
Dye then, I dare forget; farewell
Farewell Sister.
Farewell for ever, see me buried.
Stay.
Pray stay? hoe's all my brothers: no way Siphax.
No other Woman,
None, none, she or sinking.
Go and hope well, my life isle venture for thee
And all my art, a Woman may work miracles;
No more, pray heartily against my fortunes,
For much I fear a maine one.
I shall doe it. 
Find him by any means; and good child tell him
He has forgot his old friend, give him this,
And say this night without excuse or business
As ever he may find a friend, come to me,
He knows the way and how, begone.
I gallop. 
I have bin looking you;
The fair Cleanthe,
What may your business be?
O holy Mother
Such business of such strange waite, now or never.
As ye have loved me, as ye doe or may doe,
When I shall find a fit time.
If by my means
Your business may be fitted; ye know me,
And how I am tied unto you; be bold daughter
To build your best hopes,
O but it is a strange one
Stuck with as many dangers -
Ther's the working,
Small things perform themselves and give no pleasures;
Be confident through death isle serve.
Here.
Fie no corruption
Take it; it is yours,
Be not so spiced, it is good gold
And goodness is no gall to'th conscience,
I know you have ways to vent it: ye may hold it
Isle keep it for ye; when?
To morrow morning
Isle visit ye again; and when occasion
Offers it self -
Instruct me, and have at ye -
Farewell till then; be sure.
As your own thoughts, Lady.
It is a maine work and full of fear.
Fools only
Make their effects seem fearful: farewell daughter.
This gold was well got for my old tuff Soldier
Now I shall be his sweet again; what business
Is this she has a foot? some lusty lover
Beyond her line, the young wench would fine piddle
A little to revive her, must be thought of,
It is even so; she must have it; but how by my means
A devil can she drive it? I that wait still
Before the Goddess giving Oracle
How can I profit her? it is her own project,
And if she cast it false her own fault be it. 
Why this is utter madness
Thus it is Sir
Only the Princess sight?
All we can judge at;
This must be loo'kt to timely.
Yes and wisely;
He do's not offer at his life
not yet sir
That we can hear of
Noble Gentlemen;
Let me entreat your watches over him.
Ye cannot doe a worthier work.
We came Sir
Provided for that service?
Where is Chilax?
A little busy Sir?
Is the fool and boy here.
They are Sir,
Let 'em be still so; and as they find his humours
Now ye may behold him
Stand close and work no noise;
By his eyes now, Gentlemen,
I guess him full of anger
Be not seen there
The houre's past long ago, hes false and fearful,
Coward go with thy catine soul, thou our dog.
Thou cold clod, wilde fire warm thee, monstrous fearful,
I know the slave shakes but to think on it.
Whose that?
I know not Sir.
But I shall catch ye rascal,
Your mangy soul is not immortal here Sir,
Ye must die, and we must meet; we must, maggot,
Be sure we must, for not a nook of hell,
Not the most horrid pit shall harbour thee.
The Devils tail shall hide thee, but isle have thee,
And how isle use thee, whips and firebrands
Tosting thy tail against a flame of wilde fire,
And basting it with brimstone, shall be nothing,
Nothing at all; isle reach ye to be treacherous;
Was never slave so ???winged since hell was hell
As I will swinge thy slaves soul: and be sure on it.
Is this imagination, or some circumstance
For it is extreme strange.
So is all he does Sir
Till then isle leave ye? whose there? wheres the Surgeon.
Demagoras.
My Lord,
Bring the Surgeon.
And waite you too. 
What wood ye with a Surgeon
Things mustering in his head: pray mark
Come hither.
Have you brought your Instruments.
They are within Sir,
Put to the doors a while there; ye can incise
To a hairs breadth without defacing;
Yes sir.
And take out fairly from the flesh;
The least thing.
Well, come hither then; take off my doublet,
???or look ye Surgeon, I must have ye cut
My Heart out here, and handsomely: Nay, stare not,
Nor doe not start; I'll cut your throat else Surgeon,
Come swear to doe it.
Good sir???
Sir, hold him,
I'll have but one blow at his head.
I'll doe it,
Why what should we doe living after you sir?
We'll die before if ye please.
No, No.
Living? hang living,
Is there ne'er a Cat hole where I may creep through?
Wooed I were in the Indies.
Swear then, and after my death presently
To kill your selves and follow, as ye are honest,
As ye have faiths and loves to me.
We'll doe it.
Pray doe not stir yet, we are near enough
To run between all dangers.
Here I am sir;
Come look upon me, view the best way boldly,
Fear nothing but cut home; if your hand shake sir,
Or any way deface my heart in the cutting,
Make the least scratch upon it, but draw it whole,
Excellent fair, showing at all points, Surgeon,
The honour and the valour of the owner,
Mixed with the most immaculate love I send it,
Look too't, I'll slice thee to the soul.
Ne'er fear sir,
I'll doe it daintily; would I were out once.
I will not have ye smile sir when ye do it,
As though ye cut a Ladies corn; tic scurvy;
Doe me it as thou dost thy prayers, seriously.
I'll doe it in a dump sir.
In a dog sir,
I'll have no dumps, nor dumplings: fetch your tools,
And then I'll tell ye more.
If I return
To hear more I'll be hanged for it.
Quick, quick.
Yes sir,
With all the heals we have, 
Yet stand.
He will doe it.
He cannot and we here.
Why when ye rascals,
Ye dull slaves: will ye come sir? Surgeon, Serring,
Dogleach, shall I come fetch ye?
Now i'll to him,
God save ye honoured brother
My dear Polidor,
Welcome from travel welcome; and how doe ye?
Well sir, would you were so.
I am, I thank ye,
You are a bettered man much, I the same still,
An old rude Soldier, sir.
Pray be plain brother,
And tell me but the meaning of this vision,
For to me it appears no more: so far
From common course and reason.
Thank thee Fortune,
At length I have found the man: the man must do it,
The man in honour bound.
To doe what?
Hark, for I will bless ye with the circumstance
Of that weak shadow that appeared.
Speak on sir. 
It is no story for all ears.
The Princess?
Peace and hear all: how:
Sure it is dangerous
He starts so at it,
Your heart, doe ye know sir?
Yes, pray thee be softer.
Me to doe it?
Only Reserved, and dedicated.
For shame brother
Know, what, ye are, a man.
None of your Athens
Good sweet sir, no Philosophy, thou feel not
The honourable end, fool.
I am sure I feel
The shame &amp; scorn that follows; have ye served thus long
The glory of your Country, in your Conquests,
The envy of your neighbours, in your virtues,
Ruled Armies of your own, given Laws to Nations,
Beloved and feared as far as Fame has travelled,
Called the most fortunate and happy Memnon,
To loose all here at home, poorly to loose it,
Poorly and pettishly, ridiculously
To fling away your fortune? whore's your wisdom?
Whore's that you governed others by, discretion?
Do's your Rule lastly hold upon your self? fie brother,
How are ye fallen? get up into your honour
The top branch of your bravery, and from thence
Look and lament how little Memnon seems now.
Hum! tic well spoken; but dost thou think, young scholar
The tongues of Angels from my happiness
Could turn the end I aim at? no: they cannot;
This is no book case brother: will ye doe it?
Use no more art, I am resolved.
Ye may, sir
Command me to doe any thing that's honest,
And for your noble end: but this it carries.
Ye shall not be so honoured; live an Ass still,
And learn to spell for profit: go, go study.
Ye must not hold him up so, he is lost then.
Get thee to school again, and talk of turnips,
And find the natural cause out, why a dog
Turns thrice about ever he lie down: there's learning.
Come, I will doe it now; it is brave, I find it,
And now allow the reason.
O doe ye so sir,
Doe ye find it currant?
Yes, yes, excellent.
I told ye.
I was foolish: I have here too
The rarest way to find the truth out; hark ye,
Ye shall be ruled by me.
I will be: but???
I reach it,
If the worst fall, have at the worst: we'll both go
But two days, and it is thus; ha?
Twill doe well so
Then if not excellent, doe ye conceive it
Twill work for certain
O twill tickle her
And you shall know then by a line
I like it
But let me not be fooled again
Doubt nothing
You doe me wrong then, get ye in there private
As I have taught ye; Basta
Work
I will doe
Have ye found the cause
Yes, and the straingest, Gentlemen,
That ere I heard of, anon isle tell ye; Stremon
Be you still near him to affect his fancy
And keep his thoughts off: Let the Fool and Boy
Stay him, they may doe some pleasure too; Eumenes
What if he had a wench, an handsome whore brought
Rarely dressed up, and taught to state it?
Well Sir
His cause is merely heat: and made believe
It were the Princess mad for him,
I think
It were not amiss.
And let him kiss her
What else?
Isle be his bawd ant please you, young and wholesome
I can assure ye he shall have
Faith let him
A shall, I hope twill help him, walk a little
Isle tell you how his case stands, and my project
In which you must be mourners, but by all means
Stir not you from him: Stremon.
On our Lives Sir
O you're a precious Man; two days in town
And never see your old friend?
Prithe pardon me
And in my conscience if I had not sent
No more I would a come; I must
I find ye
God a mercy want ye never care for me
But when your slops are empty
Ne'er fear that wench
Shall find good currant coin still; is this the old house?
Have ye forgot it?
And the door still standing
That goes into the Temple?
Still.
The Robes to,
That I was wont to shift in here?
All here still.
O ye tuff rogue what troubles have I trotted through?
What fears and frights, every poor mouse a monster
That I heard stir, and every stick I trod on
A sharp sting to my conscience
Las poor conscience,
And all to liquor thy old boots wench
Out beast!
To new carine thy carcass, that's the truth on it
How does thy keel? does it need nailing? a tother
When all thy linen's up: and a more yare?
Fie Fie Sir
Ne'er steamed the straights?
How you talk?
I am old wench,
And talking to an old Man is like a stomacher
It keeps his blood warm
But; pray tell me
Any thing
Where did the boy meet with ye, at a wench sure,
At one end of a wench, a Cup of wine sure
Thou know I am too honest
That's your fault
And that the Surgeon knows
Then farewell
I will not fail ye soon
Ye shall staye Supper
I have sworn ye shall, by this ye shall
I will wench,
But after Supper for an hour, my business
And but an hour
No by this kiss, that ended
I will return and all night in thine Arms wench
No more, isle take your meaning; come it is Supper time
Thou art not well
Your grace sees more a great deal
Then I feel (yet I lye) o brother ???
Mark her,
Is not the quickness of her ey consumed, wench?
The lively red and white?
Nay she is much altered
That on my understanding, all her sleep's Lady
Which were as sound and sweet
Pray doe not force me
Good Madam where I am not, to be ill,
Conceit's a double sickness; on my faith your highness
Is mere mistaken in me
I am glad on it
Yet this I have ever noted when thou wast thus
It still forerun some strange event: my Sister
Died when thou wast thus last: hark hark ho,
What mournful noise is this comes creeping forward,
Still it grows nearer, nearer, do ye hear it?
It seems some Soldiers funeral: see it enters
What may it mean?
The Gods keep ye fair Calis
This man can speak, and well; a stands and views us
Wooed I were ne'er worse looked upon: how humbly
His eyes are cast now to the earth: pray mark him
And mark how rarely he has ranked his troubles:
See now a weeps, they all weep; a sweeter sorrow
I never looked upon nor one that braver
Became his grief; your will with us.
Great Lady
Excellent beauty
He speaks handsomely
What a rare rhetorician his grief plays,
That stop was admirable
See see thou Princess
Thou great commander of all hearts
I have found it,
Oh how my soul shakes:
See, see the noble hart
Of him that was the noblest: see and glory
Like the proud God himself in what thou hast purchased
Behold the heart of Memnon: does it start ye?
Good gods, what has his wildenes done?
Look boldly
You boldly sed you durst look wretched woman,
Nay fly not back fair folly, it is too late now
Virtue and blooming honour bleed to death here,
Take it the Legacy of Love bequeathed ye,
Of cruel Love, a cruel Legacy;
What was the will that wrought it? then can ye weep?
Embalm it in your truest tears?
If Women can weep a truth, or ever sorrow sunk yet
Into the soul of your sex, for it is a Jewel
The VVorlds worth cannot weigh down,
Take it Lady; And with it all (I dare not curse) my sorrows
And may they turn to Serpents.
How she looks
Still upon him: see now a tear steals from her
But still she keeps her ey firm
Next read this,
But since I see your spirit somewhat troubled
Isle doe it for ye
Still she eyes him mainly
Go happy heart for thou shalt lie
Entombed in her for whom I die
Example of her cruelty.
Tell her if she chance to chide
Me for slowness in her pride
That it was for her I died.
If a tear escape her eye
It is not for my memory.
But thy rights of obsequy
The Altar was my loving breast
My heart the sacrificed beast
And I was my self the Priest
Your body was the sacred shrine
Your cruel mind the power divine
Pleased with hearts of men not kine
Now it pores down
I like it rarely Lady
How greedily she swallows up his language?
Her eye inhabits on him
Cruel Lady,
Great as your beauty scornful; had your power
But equal poise on all hearts; all hearts perished;
But Cupped has more shafts then one more flames too
And now he must be open eyed, it is Justice:
Live to enjoy your longing; live and laugh at
The losses and the miseries we suffer;
Live to be spoken when your cruelty
Has cut of all the virtue from this Kingdom
Turned honour into earth, and faithful service
I swear his angers excellent
Truth and most tried love
Into disdain and downfall,
Still more pleasing,
Live then I say famous for civil slaughters,
Live and lay out your triumphs, guild your glories
Live and be spoken this is she this Lady,
This goodly Lady, yet most killing beauty;
This with the two edged eyes, the heart for hardness
Out doing rocks; and coldness, rocks of Crystal
This with the swelling soul, more coy of Courtship
Then the proud sea is when the shores embrace him
Live till the mothers find ye; read your story
And sow their barren curses on your beauty,
Till those that have enjoyed their loves despise ye,
Till Virgins pray against ye, old age find ye
And even as wasted coals glow in their dying
So may the Gods reward ye in your ashes:
But you're the Sister of my King; more prophesies
Else I should utter of ye true loves and loyal
Bless themselves ever from ye: so I leave ye
Prithee be angry still young man: good fair Sir
Chide me again, what woo???d this man doe pleased,
That in his passions can bewitch souls stay,
Upon my life she loves him
Pray stay
No
I doe command ye
No, ye cannot Lady
I have a spell against ye, Faith and Reason,
Ye are to weak to reach me: I have a heart too,
But not for hawks meat Lady
Even for Charity
Leave me not thus aflicted: you can teach me
How can you Preach that Charity to others
That in your own soul are an Atheist
Believing neither power nor fear: I trouble ye,
The Gods be good unto ye.
Amen.
Lady, 
O royal Madam, Gentlemen for heaven sake, 
Give her fresh air she comes again: away sirs
And here stand close till we perceive the working
Ye have undone all
So I fear
She loves ye
And then all hopes lost this way
Peace she rises
Now for my purpose Fortune
Wher's the Gentleman
Gone Madam
Why gone?
Has dispatch't his business
A came to speak with me
A did,
A did not
For I had many questions
On my Faith Madam, he
Talked a great while to ye
Thou conceiv'st not.
He talked not as he should doo; o my heart
Away with that sad sight; did thou ere love me?
Why doe you make that question?
If thou did
Run run wench, run: nay see how thou stir
Whither?
If it were for any thing to please thy self
Thou wood'st run to'th devil: but I am grown
Fie Lady
I ask none of your fortunes, nor your loves
None of your bent desires I slack, ye are not
In love with all men, are ye? one for shame
You will leave your honoured mistress? why doe ye stare so
What is that ye see about me, tell me;
Lord what am I become? I am not wilde sure,
Heaven keep that from me: o Cleanthe help me
Or I am sunk to death
Ye have offended and mightily, love is incensed against ye
And therefore take my Council, to the Temple
For that's the speediest physic: before the Goddess
Give your repentant prayers: ask her will
And from the Oracle attend your sentence
She is mild and merciful
I will: o Venus
Even as thou love thy self!
Now for my fortune
What shall I doe?
Why make your self
I dare not,
No Gentlemen, I dare not be a villain
Though her bright beauty would entice an Angel
I will to'th King my last hope: get him a Woman
As we before concluded: and as ye pass
Give out the Spartans are in arms; and terrible
And let some letters to that end be feigned too
And sent to you, some Poets too, to the General
And let me work: be ne'er him still,
We will Sir
Farewell: and pray for all: what here I will ye
Doe it, and hope a fair end
The Gods speed ye. 
He lies quiet
Let him lye and as I told ye
Make ready for this show: he has divers times
Been calling upon Orpheus to appear
And show the joys: now I will be that Orpheus,
And as I play and sing like beasts and trees
I wooed have you shaped and enter: thou a Dog, fool,
I have sent about your suits: the Boy a bush,
An Ass you, you a Lion
I a dog?
Isle fit you for a Dog. Bow wow
It is excellent
Steal in and make no noise
Bow wow
Away rogue. 
Good sweet friend be not long
Thou think each hour ten
Till I be ferreting
You know I love ye
I will not be above an hour; let thy robe be ready
And the door be kept
Who knocks there? 
Yet more business?
Have ye more pensioners, the Princess woman?
Nay then isle stay a little, what games a foot now?
Now is the time
A rank bawd by this hand, too
She grinds a both sides: hey boys
How your brother Siphax?
Loves he the Princess?
Deadly, and you know
He is a Gentleman descended nobly.
But a rank knave as ever pissed
???old Mother
Here is more gold and some jewels
Here is no villainy
I am glad I came to'th hearing
Alas Daughter,
What would ye have me doe?
Hold off ye old whore;
Ther's more gold coming; alls mine, all
Doe ye shrink now,
Did ye not promise faithfully and told me
Through any danger?
Any I can wade through
Ye shall, and easily the sin not seen neither
Here is for a better stole and a new veil mother
Come ye shall be my friend: if all hit
Hang me
Isle make ye richer then the Goddess.
Say then
I am yours, what must I doe?
In the morning
But very early, will the Princess visit
The Temple of the Goddess, being troubled
With strange things that distract her: from the Oracle
(Being strongly too in love) she will demand
The Goddess pleasure, and a Man to cure her,
That Oracle you give: describe my Brother
You know him perfectly.
I have seen him often
And charge her take the next man she shall meet with
When she comes out; you understand me
Well.
Which shall be he attending; this is all
And easily without suspicion ended,
Nor none dare disobey, it is Heaven that does it,
And who dares cross it then, or once suspect it?
The venture is most easy.
I will doe it.
As ye shall prosper;
As I shall prosper.
Take this too, and farewell; but first hark hither.
What a young whores this to betray her mistress?
A thousand Cuckolds shall that husband be,
That marries thee, thou art so mischievous.
Isle put a spoke among your wheels
Be constant
It is done
Isle doe no more at drop shot then
Farewell wench. 
A stirs a stirs
Let him, I am ready for him,
He shall not this day perish, if his passions
May bee fed with Music; are they ready
All, all: see where he comes
Isle be straight for him. 
How sad he looks and sullen. 
Here are the Captains: my fears past now.
Put case in the other world
She doe not love me neither: I am old it is certain
His spirit is a little quieter.
My blood lost and my limbs stiff; my embraces
Like the cold stubborn ba???kes ???hoe???ie and hear???es
My words worse: my fame only and achievements
Which are my strength, my blood, my youth my fashion,
Must woe her, win her, wed her; that's but wind
And Women are not brought to bed with shadows:
I doe her wrong, much wrong; she is young and blessed,
Sweet as the spring, and as his blossoms tender,
And I a nipping north wind, my head ???ung
With hails, and frosty Icicles: are the souls so too
When they depart hence, lame and old, and love les?
No sure, it is ever youth there; Time and Death
Follow our flesh no more: and that forced opinion
That Spirits have no sexes, I believe not
There must be love, there is love? what art thou.
Orpheus, I am come from the deep's below,
To thee fond man the plagues of love to show:
To the fair fields where loves eternal dwell
Ther's none that came, but first they pass through hell:
Hark and beware unless thou hast loved ever,
Beloved again, thou shalt see those joys never.
Hark how they graone that dyed despairing,
O take heed thou:
Hark how they houle for over daring
All those were men.
They that be fools, and dye for fame
They loose their name,
And they that bleed
Hark how they speed.
Now in cold frosts now scorching fires,
They sit and curse their lost desires:
Nor shall these souls be free from pains and fears,
Till Women wast them over in their tears.
How should I know my passage is denied me
Or which of all the Devils dare
This Song
Was rarely formed to fit him.
Charon o Charon
Thou wafter of the souls to bliss or bant
 Who calls the Fery man of Hell?
 Come near
And say who lives in joy, and whom in fear.
 Those that dye well; Eternal joy shall follow,
Those that dye ill; their own soul say shall swallow.
 Shall thy black Bark those guilty spirits stow
That kill themselves for love?
 O no no.
My cordage cracks when such great sins are near
No wind blows fair, nor I my self can steer
 What lovers pass and in Elizium reign?
 Those gentle loves that are beloved again.
 This Soldier Loves, and fine wood dye to win,
Shall he go on?
 No it is too foul a sin
He must not come a board: I dare not row,
Storms of despair and guilty blood will blow.
 Shall time release him say?
 No, no, no no.
Nor time nor death can alter us, nor prayer;
My boat is de??? and who then d???re
But those appointed come aboard Live still,
And love by reason more???all not by will,
 And when thy Mistress shall close up thine eyes
 Then come a board and pass,
 Till when be wise
 Till when be wise.
How still he sitts: I hope this Song has settled him
He ???ites his lip, and roll?????? his fierce eyes yet
I fear for all this
Stremon still apply to him;
Give me more room then, sweetly strike divinely
Such strains and old earth moves at
The power I have over both Beast and plant
Thou man alone feelst miserable want
Strike your rare Spirits that attend my will,
And loose your savage wildness by my skill.
This Lion was a man of War that died,
As thou would doe to guild her Ladies pride
This Dog a fool that hung himself for love:
This Ape with daily hugging of a glove,
Forgot to eat and died. This goodly tree,
An usher that still grew before his Lady,
Withered at root. This, for he could not woo,
A grumbling Lawyer: This pied Bird a page,
That melted out because he wanted age.
Still these lye howling on the stigian shore,
O love no more, o love no more.
He steals off silently, as though he would sleep,
No more but all be ne'er him, feed his fancy
Good Stremon still; this may lock up his folly.
Yet Heaven knows I must fear him; away softly.
Did I not doe most doggedly?
Most rarely?
Hoe's a brave man when shall we dog again;
Untie me first for Gods sake,
Help the Boy; hoe's in a wood poor child: good honey Stremon
Lets have a bear baiting; ye shall see me play.
The rarest for a single Dog: at head all;
And if I doe not win immortal glory,
Play, Dog play Devil.
Peace for this time,
Prithee.
Lets sing him a black Santis, then lets all howl,
In our own beastly voices; tree keep your time,
Untie there; bow, wow, wow.
A way ye Ass, away,
Why let us doe something,
To satisfy the Gentleman, hoe's mad;
A Gentleman like humour and in fashion,
And must have men as mad about him.
Peace
And come in quickly, it is ten to one else
Heel find a staff to beat a dog; no more words,
Isle get ye all employment; soft soft in all, 
When came thou over wench?
But now this evening.
And have bin ever since looking out Siphax,
In the wars he would have looked me: sure has gotten
Some other Mistress.
A thousand wench, a thousand
They are as common here as Caterpillars
Among the corn, they eat up all the Soldiers,
Are they so hungry? yet by their leave Chilax,
Isle have a snatch too.
Dost thou love him still wench?
Why should I not? he had my Maiden head
And all my youth.
Thou art come the happiest
In the most blessed time, sweet wench the fittest,
If thou dare make thy fortune: by this light Cloe
And so isle kiss thee: and if thou wilt but let me,
For it is well worth a kindness.
What shoot I let ye?
Enjoy thy miniken
Thou art still old Chilax.
Still still and ever shall be: if, I say,
Thou wo't strike the stroke: I cannot doe much harm wench
Nor much good
Siphax shall be thy Husband,
Thy very Husband woman, thy fool thy Cuckold,
Or what thou wilt make him: I am over joyed,
Ravished clean ravished with this fortune; kiss me,
Or I shall loose my self,
My Husband sed ye?
Sed I? and will say Cloe; nay and doe it
And doe it home to; Peg thee as close to him
As birds are with a pin to one another;
I have it I can doe it: thou wants clothes too,
And heel be hanged unless he marry thee
Ere he maintain thee: now he has Ladies Courtiers
More then his back can bend at? multitudes
We are taken up for threshers, will ye bite?
Yes
And let me -
Yes and let ye -
What!
Why that ye wo't of.
The turn the good turn?
Any turn the Roche turn;
That's the right turn for that turns up the belly.
I cannot stay take your instructions
And something toward household, come, what ever
I shall advise ye follow it exactly
And keep your times I point ye; for isle tell ye
A strange way you must wade through.
Fear not me Sir.
Come then and lets dispatch this modicum
For I have but an hour to stay, a short one
Besides more water for another mill
An old weak over shot I must provide for,
Ther's an old Nunnery at hand.
VVhat's that
A bawdy House.
A pox consume it
If the stones (it is buy???t on)
Were but as brickle as the flesh lives in it,
Your curse came handsomely: fear not, ther's Ladies,
And other good sad people: your pinked Citizens
That think no shame to shake a sheet there: Come wench
A Soldier and so fearful?
Can ye blame me;
When such a waite lies on me?
Fie upon ye
I tell ye, ye shall have her: have her safely,
And for your wife with her own will,
Good Sister-
What a distrustful man are you? to morrow,
To morrow morning -
Is it possible?
Can there be such a happiness?
Why hang me
If then ye be not married: if to morrow night,
Ye doe not -
O dear Sister -
What ye wooed doe
What ye desire to doe; lie with her: Devil,
What a dull man are you?
Nay I believe now,
And shall she love me?
As her life and stroke ye,
O I will be her servant,
It is your duty,
And she shall have her whole will,
Yes it is reason,
She is a Princes, and by that rule boundless
What wood' you be, for I wooed have ye Sister
Choose some great place about us: as her woman
Is not so fit.
No, no, I shall find places:
And yet to be a Lady of her bedchamber,
I hold not so fit neither,
Some great title, believe it shall be looked out.
Ye may a Duchess
Or such a toy, a small thing pleases me Sir
What you will Sister: if a neighbour Prince,
When we shall come to reign -
We shall think on it,
Be ready at the time and in that place too,
And let me work the rest, within this half hour;
The Princess will be going, it is almost morning
Away and mind your business,
Fortune bless us. 
I doe beseech your grace to banish me.
Why Gentleman is she not worthy marriage?
Most worthy, Sir, where worth again shall meet her,
But I like thick clouds sailing slow and heavy,
Although by her drawn higher, yet shall hide her
I dare not be a traitor; and it is treason,
But to imagine: as you love your honour ???
It is her first maiden doting and if crossed,
I know it kills her.
How knows your grace she loves him?
Her woman told me all; beside his story
Her maid Lucippe on what reason to,
And tic beyond all but enjoying.
Sir.
Even by your wisdom; by that great discretion
Ye owe to rule and order ???
This man's mad sure,
To plead against his fortune -
And the King too,
Willing to have it so?
By those dead Princes
From whose descents ye stand a star admired at,
Lay not so base a lay upon your virtues
Take heed for honours sake take heed: the bramble
No wise man ever planted by the rose,
It canckers all her beauty; nor the vine
When her full blushes courts the sun dares any
Choke up with wanton Ivy? good my Lords,
Who builds a monument, the Basis Jasper,
And the maine body Brick?
Ye wrong your worth,
Ye are a Gentleman descended nobly.
In both bloods truly noble.
Say ye were not,
My will can make ye so.
No, never, never;
It is not descent, nor will of Princes does it,
It is Virtue which I want, it is Temperance,
Man, honest man is it fit your Majesty
Should call my drunkenness, my rashness brother?
Or such a blessed Maid my breach of faith,
For I am most lascivious; and fell angers
In which I am also mischievous, her husband?
O Gods preserve her! I am wild as Winter,
Ambitious as the Devil: out upon me,
I hate my self, sir, if ye dare bestow her
Upon a Subject ye have one deserves her.
But him she does not love: I know your meaning.
This young mans love unto his noble brother,
Appears a mirror; what must now be done Lords?
For I am gravel'd, if she have not him
She dies for certain, if his brother miss her,
Farewell to him, and all our honours.
He is dead sir,
Your Grace has heard of that, and strangely.
No,
I can assure ye no there was a trick in it,
Read that, and then know all; what ails the gentleman?
Hold him; how doe ye sir? 
Sick ath' the sudden,
Extremely ill, wondrous ill.
Where did it take ye?
Here in my head sir, and my heart, for heaven sake.
Conduct him to his chamber presently,
And bid my Doctors???
No I shall be well sir,
I doe beseech your Grace even for the Gods sake
Remember my poor brother, I shall pray then.
Away he grows more weaker still: I will do it,
Or heaven forget me ever. Now your Counsels, 
For I am at my wits end; what with you sir?
Letters from warlike Pelius.
Yet more troubles?
The Spartans are in Arms, and like to win all:
Supplies are sent for and the General;
This is more cross then tother; come let's to him,
For he must have her, it is necessity,
Or we must lose our honours, let's plead all,
For more then all is needful, show all reason
If love can hear a that side, if she yield
We have fought best and won the noblest field. 
I have brought the wench, a lusty wench,
And somewhat like the Princess.
It is the better, let's see her,
And go you in and tell him, that her Grace
Is come to visit him? how sleeps he Stremon?
He cannot, only thinks, and calls on Polidor,
Swears a will not be fooled; sometimes he rages,
And sometimes sits and muses. 
He's past all help sure?
How doe ye like her?
Byth' mass a good round Virgin,
And at first sight resembling, she is well clothed too.
But is she sound?
Of wind and limb, I warrant her.
You are instructed Lady?
Yes, and know sir
How to behave my self, ne'er fear.
Polibius,
Where did he get this Vermin?
Hang him Badger,
There's not a hole free from him, whores and whores mates,
Doe all pay him obedience.
Indeed in the war,
His quarter was all whore, whore upon whore,
And lined with a whore, beshrew me it is a fair whore.
She has smocked away her blood; but fair or foul,
Or blind or lame, that can but lift her leg up
Comes not amiss to him, he rides like a night mare,
All ages, all Religions.
Can ye state it?
I'll make a shift.
He must lie with ye, Lady.
Let him, he's not the first man I have lain with,
Nor shall not be the last.
A comes, no more words,
She has her lesson thoroughly; how he views her?
Go forward now, so, bravely, stand!
Great Lady,
How humbly I am bound???
You shall not kneel sir,
Come, I have done you wrong; stand up my Soldier,
And thus I make amends ??? 
A plague confound ye,
Is this your state?
It is well enough.
O Lady,
Your royal hand, your hand my dearest beauty
Is more then I must purchase: here divine one,
I dare revenge my wrongs: ha?
A damned foul one.
The Lees of bawdy prawns: mourning gloves?
All spoiled by heaven.
Ha! who art thou?
A shame on ye,
Ye clawing scabby whore.
I say, who art thou?
Why it is the Princess sir.
The devil sir,
It is some rogue thing.
If this abuse be love sir,
Or I that laid aside my modesty???
So far thou't never find it.
Doe not weep,
For if ye be the Princess, I will love ye,
Indeed I will, and honour ye, fight for ye,
Come wipe your eyes; by heaven she stinks; who art ta?
Stinks like a poisoned Ratt behind a hanging?
Woman who art ta? like a rotten Cabbage.
You're much to blame sir, it is the Princess.
How?
She the Princess?
And the loving Princess.
Indeed the doting Princess.
Come hither once more,
The Princess smells like mornings breath, pure Amber,
Beyond the courted Indies in her spices
Still a dead rat by heaven; thou art a Princess.
What a dull whore is this?
I'll tell ye presently,
For if she be a Princess, as she may be
And yet stink too, and strongly, I shall find her;
Fetch the Numidian Lyon I brought over,
If she be sprung from royal blood, the Lyon
He'll doe ye reverence, else
I beseech your Lordship?
He'll tear her all to pieces.
I am no Princess, sir.
Who brought thee hither?
If ye confess, we'll hang ye.
Good my Lord;
Who art thou then?
A poor retaining whore, sir,
To one of your Lordships Captains.
Alas poor whore,
Go, be a whore still, and stink worse: 
What fools are these, and coxcombs? 
I am right glad yet,
He takes it with such lightness.
Me thinks his face too,
Is not so clouded as it was; how he looks?
Whore's your dead Rat?
The devil dine upon her
Lyons, why what a medicine had he gotten
To try a whore?
Here's one from Polidor stays to speak with ye.
With whom?
With all; where has the General bin?
Hoe's laughing to himself extremely.
Come,
I'll tell thee how: I am glad yet he's so merry. 
What lights are those that enter there, still nearer?
Plague a your rotten itch, do you draw me hither
Into the Temple to betray me? was there no place
To satisfy your sin in? Gods forgive me,
Still they come forward;
Peace ye fool, I have found it,
It is the young Princess Calis.
It is the devil
To claw us for our caterwauling.
Retire softly,
I did not look for you these two hours, Lady,
Beshrew your hast: that way,
That goes to th'Altar?
Ye old blind Beast.
I know not any way;
Still they come nearer,
I'll in to th'Oracle;
That's well remembered Isle in with ye;
Doe. 
O fair sweet Goddess Queen of Loves,
Soft and gentle, as thy Doves,
Humble eyed, and ever ruing
Those poor hearts, their Loves pursuing:
O thou mother of delights,
Coroner of all happy nights,
Star of dear content, and pleasure
Of mutual loves the endless treasure,
Accept this sacrifice we bring
Thou continual youth and Spring,
Grant this Lady her desires,
And every hour, we'll crown thy fires.
You about her all retire,
Whilst the Princess feeds the fire,
When your Devotions ended be
To the Oracle I will attend ye.
Hee will abroad.
How does his humour hold him?
He is now grown wondrous sad, weeps often too,
Talks of his brother to himself, starts strangely.
Does he not curse?
No.
Nor break out in fury,
Offering some new attempt?
Neither, to the Temple
Is all we hear of now: what there he will doe;
I hope repent his folly, let's be near him.
Where are the rest?
About a business
Concerns him mainly, if heaven cure this madness,
He's man for ever Stremon.
Does the King know it?
Yes, and much troubled with it, is now gone
To seek his sister out.
Come let's away then. 
Peace to your prayers Lady, will it please ye
To pass on to the Oracle.
Most humbly. 
Doe ye hear that?
Yes, lie close.
A wildfire take ye,
What shall become of me? I shall be hanged now.
Is this a time to shake? a halter shake ye,
Come up and juggle, come.
I am monstrous fearful.
Up ye old gaping Oyster, up and answer,
A mouldy mange upon your chops, ye told me
I was safe here till the Bell rung.
I was prevented,
And did not look these three hours for the Princess.
Shall we be taken?
Speak for loves sake Chilax?
I can not, nor I dare not.
I'll speak treason, for I had as lieve be hanged for that
Good Chilax.
Must it be sung or sed? what shall I tell 'em?
They are here? here now preparing.
O, my conscience!
Plague a your spurgall'd conscience, does it tyre now?
Now when it should be tuffest? I could make thee???
Save us, wee are both undone else.
Down ye dog then,
Be quiet, and be stanch to no inundations.
Here kneel again, and Venus grant your wishes.
O Divine star of Heaven,
Thou in power above the seven:
Thou sweet kindler of desires,
Till they grow to mutual fires:
Thou, O gentle Queen that art,
Curer of each wounded heart.
Thou the fuel, and the flame;
Thou in heaven, and here the same:
Thou the wooer, and the wood:
Thou the hunger, and the food:
Thou the prayer, and the prayed;
Thou what is, or shall be said:
Thou still young, and golden tressed,
Make me by thy Answer blessed.
When?
Now speak handsomely, and small by all means,
I have told ye what. 
But I'll tell you a new tale
Now for my neck verse; I have heard thy prayers,
And mark me well.
The Goddess is displeased much,
The Temple shakes and totters: she appears,
Bow, Lady, bow.
Purge me the Temple round,
And live by this example henceforth sound
Virgin, I have seen thy tears,
Heard thy wishes and thy fears,
Thy holy Incense flew above,
Hark therefore, thy doom in love,
Had thy heart bin soft at first,
Now thou had allayed thy thirst:
Had thy stubborn will but bended,
All thy sorrows here had ended;
Therefore be just in love,
And strange fortune thou must prove,
And, for thou hast bin sterne and coy,
A dead love thou shalt enjoy.
O gentle goddess!
Rise, thy doom is sed,
And fear not; I shall please thee with the dead, 
Go up into the Temple and there end
Your holy rites, the Goddess smiles upon ye.
I'll no more Oracles, nor Miracles,
Nor no more Church work, Isle be drawn &amp; hanged first:
Am not I torn a pieces with the thunder?
Death, I can scarce believe I live yet,
It ga???e me on the buttocks, a cruel, a huge bang,
I had as lieve a had 'em scratched with dog-whips;
Be quiet henceforth, now ye feel the end on it,
I would advise ye my old friends the good gentlewoman
Is stricken dumb and there her grace sits mumping
Like an old Ape eating a Brawn; sure the good Goddess
Knew my intent was honest, to save the Princess.
And how we young men are enticed to wickedness
By these lewd women, I had paid for it else too:
I am monstrous holy now, and cruel fearful,
O! it was a plaguy thump, charged with a vengeance.
Wooed I were well at home; the best is it is not day:
Who's that? ha? Siphax? I'll be with you anon, sir,
Ye shall be Oracled I warrant ye,
And thunderd too as well as I: your Lordship
Must needs enjoy the Princess, yes, ha! torches?
And Memnon coming this way, he's dog mad,
And ten to one appearing thus unto him,
Hee worries me, I must go by him.
Sir?
Ask me no further questions; what art thou?
How dost thou stare? stand off; nay look upon me,
I doe not shake, nor fear thee. ??? 
A will kill me,
This is for Church work.
Why dost thou appear now?
Thou were fairly slain: I know thee Diocles,
And know thine envy to mine honour: but???
Stay Memnon,
I am a Spirit, and thou can not hurt me.
This is the voice of Chilax.
What makes he thus?
It is true that I was slain in field, but foully
By multitudes not manhood: therefore mark me,
I doe appear again to quit mine honour,
And on thee single.
I accept the challenge.
Where?
On the Stigian banks
When?
Four days hence.
Go noble Ghost, I will attend.
I thank ye.
Ye have saved your throat and handsomely:
Farewell sir. 
Sing me the Battle of Pelusium,
In which this Worthy died.
This will spoil all, and make him worse
Then ere he was, sit down sir,
And give your self to rest.
Arm, arm, arm, arm, the Scouts are all come in
Keep your ranks close and now your honours win.
Behold from yonder hill, the foe appears,
Bows, bills gloves arrows shields, and Spears,
Like a dark wood he comes, or tempest pouring,
O view the wings of horse, the meadows scouring,
The vant-guard marches bravely, hark the Drums???dub, dub,
They meet they meet, now the Battle comes,
See how the Arrows fly
That darken all the sky,
Hark how the Trumpets sound,
Hark how the hills rebound, ??? Tara-tara-tara.
Hark how the horses charge: in boys in boys in,-tara, tara,
The Battle totters; now the wounds begin,
O how they cry,
O how they die.
Room for the valiant Memnon, armed with thunder,
See how he breaks the ranks asunder:
They fly they fly Eumenes has the Chase,
And brave Polibius, makes good his place.
To the plains to the Wood,
To the Rocks to the floods,
They fly for succour: Follow, follow, follow, Hey, hey.
Hark how the Soldiers hollow
Brave Diocles is dead,
And all his Soldiers fled,
The battell's won, and lost,
That many a life hath cost.
Now forward to the Temple. 
Are ye gone?
How have I escaped this morning? by what miracle?
Sure I am ordained for some brave end.
How is it?
Come, it is as well as can be.
But is it possible
This should be true you tell me?
It is most certain.
Such a gross Ass to love the Princess?
Peace,
Pull your robe close about ye: you are perfect
In all I taught ye.
Sure.
Gods give thee good luck,
It is strange my brains should still be beating knavery
For all these dangers: but they are needful mischiefs,
And such are Nuts to me, and I must doe 'em,
You will remember me???
By this kiss Chilax.
No more of that, I fear another Thunder.
We are not in the Temple man.
Peace, here he comes,
Now to our business handsomely: away now. 
It was sure the Princess, for he kneeled unto her,
And she looked every way: I hope the Oracle
Has made me happy: me I hope she looked for.
Fortune, I will so honour thee, Love so adore thee,
She is here again looks round about again too,
It is done, I know it is done; it is Chilax with her,
And I shall know of him; whose that?
Speak softly,
The Princess from the Oracle.
She views me,
By heaven she beckons me.
Come near, she wooed have ye.
O royal Lady. 
She wills ye read that, for belike she's bound to si???lence
For such a time; she is wondrous gracious to ye.
Heaven make me thankful.
She wooed have ye read it, 
Siphax, the will of Heaven hath cast me on thee
To be thy wife, whose will must be obeyed:
Use me with honour, I shall love thee dearly,
And make thee understand thy words hereafter;
Convey me to a secret Ceremony,
That both our hearts and loves may be united,
And use no language, till before my brother
We both appear, where I will show the Oracle,
For till that time I am bound, I must not answer.
O happy I!
Ye are a made man.
But Chilax
Where are her women?
None but your Graces Sister,
Because she would have it private to the world yet,
Knows of this business.
I shall thank the Chilax,
Thou art a careful man.
Your Graces servant.
I'll find a sit place for thee.
If you will not,
There's a good Lady will, she points ye forward,
Away and take your fortune, not a word sir,
So, you are greased I hope. 
Stremon, Fool, Picus.
Where have you left your Lord?
In the Temple, Chilax.
Why are ye from him?
Why the King is with him,
And all the Lords.
Is not the Princess there too.
Yes,
And the strangest coil amongst 'em: She weeps bitterly;
The King entreats, and frowns, my Lord like Autumn
Drops off his hopes by handfuls, all the Temple
Sweats with this Agony.
Whore's young Polidor?
Dead as they said of the sudden.
Dead?
For certain,
But not yet known abroad,
There's a new trouble;
A brave young man he was; but we must all die.
Did not the General meet you this morning
Like a tall stallion Nun?
No more a that Boy.
You had been ferreting.
That's all one, Fool;
My Master fool that taught my wits to traffic,
What has your wisdom done? how have you profited?
Out with your Audit, come: you are not empty,
Put out mine eye with twelve pence? do you shaker?
What think you of this shaking? here's with coxcomb
Ha boys? ha my fine rascals, here's a Ring, 
How right they go?
O let me ring the fore-bell.
And here are thumpers, Chickens, golden rogues,
???it wit ye rascals.
I have a Sty here Chilax.
I have no gold to cure it, not a penny,
Not one cross Cavalier; we are dull Sou'diers,
Gross, heavy-headed fellows; fight for victuals?
Why; ye are the spirits of the time.
By no means.
The valiant fiery.
Fie, fie no.
Be-lee-me sir.
I wooed I could sir.
I will satisfy ye.
But I will not content you; alas poor boy,
Thou show an honest nature weeps for thy Master,
There's a red rogue to buy thee handkerchers.
A was an honest Gentleman, I have lost too.
Ye have indeed your labour Fool; but Stremon,
Doest thou want money too? no virtue living?
No firking out at fingers ends?
It seems so.
Will ye all serve me?
Yes, when ye are Lord General,
For less I will not go.
There's gold for thee then,
Thou hast a soldiers mind, Fool.
Here, your first man.
I will give thee for thy wit, for it is a fine wit,
A dainty diving wit, hold up; just nothing,
Go graze in the commons, yet I am merciful
There's six pence; buy a Saucer, steal an old gown,
And beg in the Temple for a Prophet, come away boys,
Let's see how things are carried, Fool, up sir,
You may chance get a dinner: Boy your preferment
I'll undertake, for your brave Masters sake,
You shall not perish.
Chilax.
Please me well Fool,
And you shall light my pipes: Away to the Temple.
But stay, the Kings here, sport upon sport Boys.
What would you have Captain,
Speak suddenly, for I am wondrous busy.
A Pardon, Royal sir.
For what?
For that,
Which was heavens will, should not be mine alone sir;
My marrying with this Lady.
It needs no Pardon,
For marriage is no sin.
Not in it self, sir,
But in presuming too much: Yet heaven knows
So does the Oracle that cast it on me,
And ??? the Princess, royal sir.
What Princess?
O be not angry, my dread King, your Sister.
My sister? she's in the Temple man.
She is here sir.
The Captain's mad, she is kneeling at the Altar.
I know she is, with all my heart good Captain,
I do forgive ye both: be unvailed Lady; 
Will ye have more forgiveness? the mans frantic,
Come let's go bring her out: God give ye joy sir.
How? Cloe? my old Cloe?
Even the same sir.
Gods give your manhood much c???ntent.
The Princess
Looks something musty since her coming over.
It were good, youl'd brush her over.
Fools and Fiddlers
Make sport at my abuse too.
O it is the nature
Of us Fools to make bold with one another,
But you are wise, brave sirs.
Cheer up your Princess,
Believe it sir, the King will not be angry,
Or say he were; why it was the Oracle,
The Oracle, and like your Grace, the Oracle.
And who, most mighty Siphax?
With mine own whore.
With whom else should ye marry speak your conscience,
Will ye transgress the law of Arms, that ever
Rewards the Soldier with his own sins?
Devils.
Ye had my maiden-head my youth, my sweetness,
Is it not justice then? ???
I see it must be,
But by this hand. I'll hang a lock upon thee.
You shall not need, my honesty shall doe it.
If there be wars in all the world???
I'll with ye,
For you know, I have bin a soldier,
Come, curse on: when I need another Oracle.
Send for me Siphax, I'll fit ye with a Princess,
And so to both your honours.
And your graces.
The Devil grace ye all.
God a mercy Chilax,
Shall we laugh half an hour now?
No the King comes,
And all the train.
Away then, our Act's ended. 
You know he do's deserve ye, loves ye dearly,
You know what bloody violence had used
Upon himself, but that his brother crossed it,
You know the same thoughts still inhabit in him
And covet to take birth: Look on him Lady,
The wars have not so far consumed him yet,
Cold age disabled him, or sickness sunk him
To be abhorred: look on his Honour sister,
That bears no stamp of time, no wrinkles on it,
No sad demolishment, nor death can reach it:
Look with the eyes of heaven that nightly waken,
To view the wonders of my glorious Maker,
And not the weakness: look with your virtuous eyes,
And then clad royalty in all his conquests;
His matchless love hung with a thousand merits
Eternal youth attending, Fame and Fortune,
Time and Oblivion vexing at his virtues,
He shall appear a miracle: look on our dangers,
Look on the public ruin.
O, dear brother.
Fie, let us not like proud and greedy waters
Gain, to give off again: this is our Sea,
And you his Cynthia, govern him, take heed,
His stouds have bin as hie, and full as any,
And gloriously now is got up to the girdle,
The Kingdoms he hath purchased; noble Sister,
Take not your virtue from him, O take heed
We ebb not now to nothing, take heed Calis.
The will of heaven not mine, which must not alter,
And my eternal doom for ought I know
Is fixed upon me; alas, I must love nothing.
Nothing that loves again must I be blessed with:
The gentle Vine climbs up the Ok and clips him.
And when the stroke comes, yet they fall together;
Death death must I enjoy, and live to love him,
O noble Sir!
Those tears are some reward yet,
Pray let me wed your sorrows.
Take 'em Soldier,
They are fruitful ones, lay but a fight upon 'em,
And strait they will conceive to infinites;
I told ye what, ye could find 'em,
Room before there. 
How now, what's this? more drops to th'Ocean?
Whose body's this?
The noble Polidor,
This speaks his death.
My Brother dead?
O Goddess!
O cruel, cruel Venus, here's my fortune.
Read Captain.
Read aloud: farewell my follies. 
Be wise, as you are beauteous, love with judgement,
And look with clear eyes on my noble Brother,
Value desert and virtue, they are Jewels,
Fit for your worth and wearing: take heed Lady,
The Gods reward ingratitude most grievous;
Remember me no more, or if you must,
Seek me in noble Memnons love, I dwell there:
I durst not live, because I durst not wrong him,
I can no more, make me eternal happy
With looking down upon your loves.
And did thou die for me?
Excellent virtue!
What will ye now doe?
Dwell for ever here sir.
For me dear Polidor? ?? worthy young man!
O love, love, love, love above recompense!
Infinite love, infinite honesty!
Good Lady leave, you must have no share here,
Take home your sorrows: here's enough to store me,
Brave glorious griefs! was ever such a brother?
Turn all the stories over in the world yet,
And search through all the memories of mankind,
And find me such a friend; he has out-done all.
Outstripped 'em sheerely, all, all, thou hast Polidor,
To die for me; why, as I hope for happiness,
It was one of the rarest thought on things
The bravest, and carried beyond compass of our actions,
I wonder how he hit it, a young man too,
In all the blossoms of his youth and beauty,
In all the fullness of his veins and wishes
Wood by that Paradise, that would catch heaven;
It starts me extremely, thou blessed Ashes,
Thou faithful monument, where love and friendship
Shall while the world is, work new miracles.
O! let me speak too.
No not yet, thou man,
For we are but mans shadows, only man,
I have not words to utter him; speak Lady,
I'll think a while.
The Goddess grants me this yet,
I shall enjoy the dead: no tomb shall hold thee
But these two arms, no Trickments but my tears
Over thy Hearse, my sorrows like sad arms
Shall hang for ever: on the tuffest Marble
Mine eyes shall weep thee out an Epitaph,
Love at thy feet shall kneel, his smart bow broken;
Faith at thy head, youth and the Graces mourners;
O sweet young man!
Now I begin to melt too.
Have ye enough yet Lady? room for a gamester
To my fond Love, and all those idle fancies
A long farewell, thou died for me dear Polidor,
To give me peace, thou hast eternal glory,
I stay and talk here; I will kiss thee first,
And now I'll follow thee. 
Hold, for heavens sake!
Ha!
Does he live?
Dost thou deceive me?
Thus far,
Yet for your good, and honour.
Now dear sister;
The Oracle is ended, noble sir,
Dispose, me now as you please.
You are mine then?
With all the joys that may be.
Your consent sir;
Ye have it freely.
Walk along with me then,
And as you love me, love my will.
I will so.
Here worthy Brother, take this virtuous Princess,
Ye have deserved her nobly, she will love ye,
And when my life shall bring ye peace, as she does,
Command it, ye shall have it.
Sir, I thank ye.
I never found such goodness in such years.
Thou shalt not over-doe me, though I die for it,
O how I love thy goodness, my best brother,
You have given me here a treasure to enrich me,
Would make the worthiest King alive a beggar,
What may I give you back again?
Your love sir.
And you shall have it, even my dearest love,
My first, my noblest love, take her again, sir,
She is yours, your honesty has over-run me,
She loves ye, love her not? excellent Princess,
Enjoy thy wish, and now get Generals.
As ye love heaven, love him, she is only yours, sir.
As ye love heaven, love him, she is only yours, sir;
My Lord, the King.
He will undo himself sir,
And must without her perish; who shall fight then?
Who shall protect your Kingdom?
Give me hearing,
And after that belief, were she my soul
(As I doe love her equal) all my victories,
And all the living names I have gained by war,
And loving him that good, that virtuous good man,
That only worthy of the name of brother,
I would resign all freely, it is all love
To me, all marriage rites, the joy of issues
To know him fruitful, that has been so faithful.
This is the noblest difference-take your choice sister.
I see they are so brave, and noble both,
I know not which to look on.
Choose discreetly,
And virtue guide ye, there all the world in one man
Stands at the mark.
There all mans honesty,
The sweetness of all youth ???
O God's!
My Armour,
By all the God's she's yours; my arms, I say,
And I beseech your Grace, give me employment,
That shall be now my Mistress: here my Courtship.
Ye shall have any thing.
Virtuous Lady,
Remember me, your servant now; Young man,
You cannot over-reach me in your goodness;
O love! how sweet thou look now? and how gentle,
I should have slubber'd thee, and stained thy beauty;
Your hand, your hand sir;
Take her, and Heaven bless her.
So.
It is your will sir, nothing of my merit;
And as your royal gift, I take this blessing.
And I from heaven this gentleman: thanks Goddess.
So ye are pleased now Lady;
Now or never.
My cold stiff carcass, would have frozen ye,
Wars, wars.
Ye shall have wars.
My next brave battle
I dedicate to your bright honour (sister,)
Give me a favour, that the world may know
I am your soldier.
This, and all fair Fortunes.
And he that bears this from me, must strike boldly.
I do forgive thee: be honest, no more wench.
Come now to Revels, this blessed day shall prove
The happy crown of noble Faith and Love. 
TO please ell's impossible, and to despair
Ruins our selves, and dampes the Writers care:
Would we knew what to doe, or say, or when
To find the minds here equal with the men:
But we must venture; now to Sea we go,
Fair fortune with us, give us room, and blow;
Remember ye'ar all venturers; and in this Play
How many twelve-pences ye have stowed this day:
Remember for return of your delight,
We launch, and plough through storms of fear, and spite:
Give us your fore-windes fairly, fill our wings,
And steer us right, and as the Sailors sing,
Laden with Wealth, on wanton seas, so we
Shall make our home-bound-voyage cheerfully;
And you our noble Merchants, for your treasure
Share equally the fraught, we run for pleasure.
HEre lies the doubt now, let our Plays be good,
Our own care sailing equal in this Flood;
Our preparations new, new our Attire,
Yet here we are becalmed still, still in the mire,
Here we stick fast; Is there no way to clear
This passage of your judgement, and our fear,
No mitigation of that law? Brave friends,
Consider we are yours, made for your ends,
And every thing preserves it self, each will
If not perverse, and crooked, utters still
The best of that it ventures in: have care
Even for your pleasures sake, of what we are,
And doe not ruin all: You may frown still.
But it is the nobler way, to check the will.
