NEw Plays, and Maidenheads, are near a kin,
Much followed both, for both much money g'yn,
If they stand sound, and well; And a good Play
(Whose modest Scenes blush on his marriage•… day,
And shake to loose his honour) is like his
That after holy Tie, and first nights stir
Yet still is Modesty, and still retains
More of the maid to sight, than Husbands pains;
We pray our Play may be so; For I am sure
It has a noble Breeder, and a pure,
A learned, and a Poet never went
More famous yet twixt Po and silver Trent.
Chaser (of all admired) the Story gives,
There constant to Eternity it lives;
If we let fall the Nobleness of this,
And the first sound this child bear, be a hiss,
How will it shake the bones of that good man,
And make him cry from under ground, O fa•…
From me the witless chafe of such a wrighter
That blasts my Baize, and my famed works makes lighter
Then Robin Hood? This is the fear we bring;
For to say Trut•…, it wa•…e an endless thing,
And too ambitious to 〈◊〉 to him;
Weak as we are, and almost breathless swim
In this deep water. 〈◊〉 you hold out
Your helping hands, and we shall take about,
And something do•… 〈◊◊〉: You shall hear
Scenes though 〈◊◊〉 Art, may yet appear
Worth two hours travel. To his •…nes sweet sleep:
Content to you. If this play doe not keep,
A little dull time from us, we perceive
Our losses fall so thick, we must needs leave.
ROses their sharpe spines being gon,
Not royal in their smells alone,
But in their hew.
Maiden Pinckes, ofodour faint,
Daisies smel-lesse, yet most quaint
And sweet Time true.
Prim-rose first borne, child of Ver,
Merry Spring times Harbinger,
With her bells dim.
Oxlips, in their Cradles growing,
Mary-golds, on death beds blowing,
Larkes-heeles trim.
All dear natures children: sweete-
Lie fore Bride and Bridegrooms feet•… 
Blessing their sense.
Not an angle of the air,
Bird mclodious, or bird fair,
Is absent hence.
The Crow, the •…ndrous Cuckoo, nor
The boding Raven, nor Clough hee
Nor •…hattring Pie,
May on our Bridehouse perch or sing,
Or with them any discord bring
But from it fly.
For pities sake and true gentilities,
Hear, and respect me.
For your Mothers sake.
And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair ones,
Hear and respect me,
Now for the love of him whom love hath marked
The honour of your Bed, and for the sake
Of clear virginity, be Advocate
For us, and our distresses: This good deed
Shall raze you out of the Book of Trespasses
All you are set down there.
Sad Lady •…ise.
Stand up.
No knees to me.
What woman I may steed that is distressed,
Does bind me to her.
What's your request? Deliver you for all.
We are 3. Queens, whose Sovereigns fell before
The wrath of cruel Croon; who endured
The Beaks of Ravens, Talents of the Knights,
And pecks of Crows, in the foul fields of The•…
He will not suffer us to burn their bones,
To urn their ashes, nor to take the off•…nce
Of mortal loathsomeness from the blessed eye
Of holy Ph•…bus, but infects the winds
With stench of our slain Lords. O pity Duke,
Thou purger of the earth, draw thy feared Sword
That does good turns to'th world; give us the Bones
Of our dead Kings, that we may Chapel them;
And of thy boundless goodness take some note
That for our crowned heads we have no roof,
Save this which is the Lyons, and the Bears,
And vault to every thing.
Pray you kneel not,
I was transported with your Speech, and suffered
Your knees to wrong themselves; I have heard the fortunes
Of your dead Lords, which gives me such lamenting
As wakes my vengeance, and revenge for'em
King Capaneus, was your Lord the day
That he should marry you, at such a season,
As now it is with me. I met your Groom,
By Marsis Altar, you were that time fair;
Not Iunos Mantle fairer then your Tresses,
Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreathe
Was then nor threashd, nor blasted; Fortune at you
Dimpled her Cheek with smiles: Hercules our kinesman
(Then weaker than your eyes) laid by his Club,
He tumbled down upon his Nenuan hide
And swore his •…ws thawd: O grief, and time,
Fearful consumers, you will all devour.
O I hope some God,
Some God hath put his mercy in your manhood
Whereto heel infuse power, and press you forth
Our undertaker.
O no knees, none Widow,
Unto the Helmeted-Belona use them,
And pray for me your Soldier.
Troubled I am.
Honoured Hypolita
Most dreaded Amazonian, that hast slain
The Sith-tuskd-Bore; that with thy Arm as strong
As it is white, wast near to make the male
To thy Sex captive; but that this thy Lord
Borne to uphold Creation, in that honour
First nature stilt it in, shrunk thee into
The bound thou wast ore-flowing; at once subduing
Thy force, and thy affection: Soldiresse
That equally can poise sternenes with pity,
Whom now I know hast much more power on him
Then ever he had on thee, who ow'st his strength
And his, Love too: who is a Servant for
The Tenor of the Speech. Dear Glass of Ladies
Bid him that we whom flaming war doth scorch,
Under the shadow of his Sword, may cool us:
Require him he advance it ore our heads;
Speak't in a women's key: like such a woman
As any of us three; weep ere you fail; lend us a knee;
But touch the ground for us no longer time
Then a Doves motion, when the head's plucked off:
Tell him if he in the blood cizd field, lay swollen
Showing the Sun his Teeth; g•…inning at the Moon
What you would doe.
Poor Lady, say no more:
I had as leife trace this good action with you
As that whereto I am going, and never yet
Went I so willing, way. My Lord is taken
Hart deep with your distress: Let him consider:
Isle speak anon.
O my petition was 
Set down in ice, which by hot grief uncandied
Melts into drops, so sorrow wanting form
Is pressed with deeper matter.
Pray stand up,
Your grief is written in your check.
O woe,
You cannot read it there; there through my tears,
Like wrinkled peobles in a glass stream
You may behold 'em (Lady, Lady, alack)
He that will all the Treasure know of the earth
Must know the Center too; he that will fish
For my least min•…ow, let him lead his line
To catch one at my heart. O pardon me
Extremity that sharpens sundry wits
Makes me a Fool.
Pray you say nothing, pray you,
Who cannot feel, nor see the rain being in it,
Knows neither wet, nor dry, if that you were
Tho ground-peece of some Painter, I would buy you
T'instruct me against a Capital grief indeed
Such heart pierced demonstration; but alas
Being a natural Si•…la of our Sex
Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me,
That it shall make a counter reflect against
My Brothers heart, and warm it to some pity
Though it were made of stone: pray have good comfort.
Forward to'th Temple, leave not out a Jot
Of the sacred Ceremony.
O This Celebration
Will long last, and be more costly then,
Your Suppliants war: Remember that your Fame
Knowles in the ear, of the world: what you doe quickly,
Is not done rashly; your first thought is more.
Then others laboured meditance: your premeditating
More then their actions: But oh love, your actions
Soon as they moves as Asprayes doe the fish,
Subdue before they touch, think, dear Duke think
What beds our slain Kings have.
What griefs our beds
That our dear Lords have none.
None fit for'th dead:
Those that with Cords, Knives, drams precipitance,
Weary of this worlds light, have to themselves
Been deaths most horrid Agents, human grace
Affords them dust and shadow.
But our Lords
Lie b•…string fore the visitating Sun,
And were good Kings, when living.
It is true. and I will give you comfort,
To give your dead Lords graves:
The which to doe, must make some work with Creou;
And that work presents it self to'th doing:
Now twill take form, the heats are gone to morrow.
Then, bootless toil must recompense it self,
With it's own sweat; Now he's secure,
Not dreams, we stand before your puislance
Wrenching our holy begging in our eyes
To make petition clear.
Now you may take him,
Drunk with his victory.
And his Army full
Of Bread, and sloth.
Artesuis that best know
How to draw out fit to this enterprise,
The prim'st for this proceeding, and the number
To carry such a business, forth and levy
Our worthiest Instruments, whilst we despatch
This grand act of our life, this daring deed
OfFate in wedlock.
Dowagers, take hands
Let us be Widows to our wo•…s, delay
Commends us to a famishing hope.
Farewell.
We come unseasonably: But when could grief
Cull forth as unpanged judgement can, fit'st time
For best solicitation.
Why good Ladies,
This is a service, whereto I am going,
Greater then any was; it more imports me
Then all the actions that I have foregone,
Or futurely can cope.
The more proclaiming
Our suit shall be neglected, when her Arms
Able to locke Jove from a Synod, shall
By warranting Moone-light corslet thee, oh when•…
Her twining Cherries shall their sweetness fall
Upon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think
Of rotten Kings or blubbered Queens, what care
For what thou feelst not? what thou feelst being able
To make Mars spurn his Drom. O if thou couc•…
But one night with her, every hour in it will
Take 〈◊〉 of thee for a hundred, and
Thou shalt remember nothing more, then what
That Banquet bids thee too.
Though much unlike
You should be so transported, as much sorry
I should be such a Suitor; yet I think
Did I not by th'abstayning of my joy
Which breeds a deeper longing, cure their surfeit
That craves a present medcine, I should pluck
All Ladies scandal on me. Therefore Sir
As I shall here make trial of my prayers,
Either presuming them to have some force,
Or sentencing for ay their vigour dombe,
Prorogue this business, we are going about, and hang
Your Shield before your Heart, about that neck
Which is my 〈◊〉, and which I freely lend
To doe these poor Queens service.
Oh help now
Our Cause cries for your knee.
If you grant not
My Sister her petition in that force,
With that Celerity, and nature which
She makes it in: from henceforth isle not dare
To ask you any thing, nor be so hardy
Ever to take a Husband.
Pray stand up.
I am entreating of my self to doe
That which you kneel to have me; •…yrithous
Lead on the Bride; g•…t you and pray the Gods
For success, and return; omit not any thing
In the pretended Celebration: Queens
Follow your Soldier (as before) hence you
And at the banckos of Anly meet us with
The forces you can raise, where we shall find
The moiety of a number, for a business,
More bigger looked; since that our Theme is haste
I stamp this kiss upon thy currant lip,
Sweet keep it as my Token; Set you forward
For I will see you gone. 
Farewell my beauteous Sister: Pyrithous
Keep the feast full, bate not an hour on it.
Sir
Isle follow you at •…eels; The Feasts solemnity
Shall want till your return.
Co•…en I charge you
Boudge not from Athens; We shall be returning
Ere you can end this Feast; of which I pray you
Make no abatement; once more farewell all.
Thus dost thou still make good the tongue of the world.
And ernst a Deity equal with Mars,
If not above him, for
Thou being but mortal make•… affections bend
To Godlike honours; they themselves some say
Groan under such a Mastry.
As we are men
Thus should we doe, being sensually subdued
We loose our humane title; good cheer Ladies. 
Now turn we towards your Comforts. 
Dear Palamon, 〈◊〉 in love then Blood
And our prime Cousin, yet unhardned in
The Crimes of nature; Let us leave the City
Thebs, and the temptings in it, before we further
Sully our gloss of youth,
And here to keep in abstinence we shame
As in Incontinence; for not to swim
In the aide of the Current, were almost to sink,
At least to frustrate striving, and to follow
The common Stream, twold bring us to an Edy
Where we should turn or drown; if labour through,
Our gain but life, and weakness.
Your advice
Is cried up with example: what strange ruins
Since first we went to School, may we perceive
Walking in Thebs? Scarce, and bar•… weeds
The gain of the Martialist, who did propound
To his bold ends, honour, and golden Ingots,
Which though he won, he had not, and now flurted
By peace for whom he fought, who then shall offer
To Marsis so scorned Altar? I doe bleed
When such I meet, and wish great 〈◊〉 would
Resume her ancient fit of Jealousy
To get the Soldier work, that peace might purge
For her repletion, and retain anew
Her cha•…itable heart now hard, and harsh•…
Then strife, or war could be.
Are you not out?
Meet you no ruin, but the Soldierin
The Cranks, and turns of Thebs' you did begin
As if you met decays of many kinds:
Perceive you none, that doe arouse your pity
But th'un considerd Soldier?
Yes, I pity
Decays where ere I find them, but such most
That sweating in an honourable Toil
Are paid with ice to coole'em.
Tic not this
I did begin to speak of: This is virtue
Of no respect in Thebs I spake of Thebs'
How dangerous if we will keep our Honours,
It is for our r•…syding, where ev•…rye evil
Hath a good cullor; where eve'ry seeming good's
A certain evil, where not to be ev•… Jump
As they are, here were to be strangers, and
Such things to be meet Monsters.
Tic in our power,
(Unless we fear that Apes can Tutor's) to
Be Masters of our manners: what need I
Affect another gate, which is not catching
Where there is faith, or to be fond upon
Another way of speech, when by mine own
I may be reasonably conceived; saved too,
Speaking it truly; why am I bound
By any generous bond to follow him
Follows his Taylor, happily so long until
The followed, make pursuit? or let me know,
Why mine own Barb•… is unblessed, with him
My poor Chin too, for tic not Cizard just
To such a Favourites glass: What Cannon is there
That does command my Rapier from my hip
To dangle it in my hand, or to go tip toe
Before the street be foul? Either I am
The fore-horse in the Team, or I am none
That draw in the sequent trace: these poor fleight sores,
Need not a plantin; That which tips my bosom
Almost to'th heart's,
Our Uncle Croon.
He,
A most unbounded Tyrant, whose successes
Makes heaven unfeard, and villainy assured
Beyond its power: there's nothing, almost puts
Faith in a fever, and deifies alone
Voluble chance, who only attributes
The faculties of other Instruments
To his own No•…ves and act; Commands men service,
And what they win in it, boot and glory on;
That fears not to do harm; good, dares not; Let
The blood of mine that's sibbe to him, be sucked
From me with Leeches, Let them break and fall
Off me with that corruption.
Clear spirited Cozen
Lets leave his Court, that we may nothing share,
Of his loud infamy: for our milk,
Will relish of the pasture, and we must
Be vile, or disobedient, not his kinesmen
In blood, unless in quality.
Nothing truer:
I think the Echoes of his shames have dea'ft
The ears of heavenly Justice: widows cries
Descend again into their throats; and have not: Enter Va∣leri•…s.
Due audio•…nce of the Gods: •…alerius
The King calls for you; yet be leaden footed
Till his great rage be off him. Phebus when
He broke his whipflocke and exclaim dagainst
The Horses of the Sun, but whispered too
The low denes•…e of his Fury.
Small winds shake him,
But whats t•…e matter?
Val. Theseus (who where he threats appals,) hath sent
Deadly defiance to him, and pronounces
Ruin to Thebs, who is at hand to seal
The promise of his wrath.
Let him approach;
But that we fear the Gods in him, he brings not
A jot of terror to us; Yet what man
Thirds his own worth (the case is each of ours)
When that his actions dregd, with mind assured
Tic ba•… he goes about.
Leave that unreasond.
Our ser•…ices stand now for Thebs, not Croon,
Yet to be neutral to him, were dishonour;
Rebellious to oppose: therefore we must
With him stand to the mercy of our Fate,
Who hath bounded our last minute.
So we must;
First sed this wars afoot? or it shall be
On fail of some condition.
Tic in motion
The intelligence of state came in the instant
With the defier.
Lets to the king, who, were he
A quarter carrier of that honour, which
His Enemy come in, the blood we venture
Should be as for our health, which were not spent,
Rather laid out for purchase: but alas
Our hands advanced before our hearts, what will
The fall of the stroke doe damage?
Let th'event,
That never erring Arbitrator, tell us
When we know all our selves, and let us follow
The becking of our chance.
No further.
Sir farewell; repeat my wishes
To our great Lord, of whose success I dare not
Make any timorous question, yet I wish him
Exces, and overflow of power, and't might be
To dure ill-dealing fortune; speed to him,
Store never hurts good Governors.
Though I know
His Ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they
Must yield their tribute there: My precious Maid,
Those best affections, that the heavens infuse
In their best tempered pieces, keep enthroand
In your dear heart.
Thanks Sir; Remember me
To our all royal Brother, for whose speed
The great 〈◊〉 isle so•…licit; and
Since in our terrene State petitions are not
Without gifts understood: Isle offer to her
What I shall be advised she likes; our hey•…ts
Are in his Army in his Tent.
In's bosom:
We have bin Soldiers, and wee cannot weep
When our Friends don their helmes, or put to sea,
Or tell of Babe, broached on the Lance, or women•…n
That have sod their Infants in (and after eat them)
Tho brine, they wept at killing 'em; Then if
You stay to see of us such Spinesters, we
Should hold you here for e ver.
Peace be to you
As I pursue this war, which shall be then
Beyond further requiring.
How his longing
Follows his Friend; since his depart, his sports
Though craving seriousness, and skill, past slightly
His careless execution, where nor gain
Made him regard, or loss consider, but
Playing ore business in his hand, another
Directing in his head, his mind, nurse equal
To these so differing Twins; have you observed him,
Since our great Lord departed?
With much labour:
And I did love him fort, they two have Cabined
In many as dangerous, as poo•…e a Corner,
Peril and want contending, they have skift
Torrents whose roaring tyranny and power
In the least of these was dreadful, and they have
Fought out together, where Deaths-selfe was lodged,
Yet fate hath brought them off: Their knot of love
Tide, weaved, entangled, with so true, so long,
And with a finger of so deep a cunning
May be out worn, never undone, I think
Theseus cannot be umpire to himself
Cleaving his conscience into twain, and doing
Each side like Justice, which he loves best.
Doubtless
There is a best, and reason has no manners
To say it is not you: I was acquainted
Once with a time, when I enjoyd a Play-fellow;
You were at wars, when she the grave enriched,
Who made too proud the Bed, took leave of the Moon
(which then looked pale at parting) when our count
Was each a eleven.
It was Flauia.
Yes
You talk of Pirithous and Theseus love;
Theirs has more ground, is more maturely seasons,
More buckled with strong Judgment. and their needs
The one of the other may be said to water
Their intertangled roots of love, but I
And she (I sigh and spoke of) were things innocent,
Loved for we did, and like the Elements
That know not what, nor why, yet doe effect
Rare issues by their operance; our souls
Did so to one another; what she liked,
Was then of me approved, what not condemned
No more arraignment, the flower that I would pl•…cke
And put between my breasts, oh (then but beginning
To swell about the blossom) she would long
Till she had such another, and commit it
To the like innocent Cradle, where Phoenix like
They did in perfume: on my head no toy
But was her pattern, her affections (pretty
Though happily, her careless, were, I followed
For my most serious decking, had mine care
Stolen some new air, or at adventure humd on
From misicall Coinage, why it was a note
Whereon her spirits would sojourn (rather dwell on)
And sing it in her slumbers; This reh•…tsall
(Which fury-innocent wots well) comes in
Like old importments baftard, h•…s this end,
That the true love tweene Maid, and maid, may be
More then in sex individual.
You're ont of breath
And this high speeded-pace, is but to say
That you shall never (like the Maid Flavina)
Love any that's called Man.
I am sure I shall not.
Now alack weak Sister,
I must no more believe thee in this point
(Though, in it I know thou dost believe thy self,)
Then I will trust a sickly appetite,
That loathés even as it longs, but sure my Sister
If I were ripe for your persuasion, you
Have said enough to shake me from the Arm
Of the all noble Theseus, for whose fortunes,
I will now in, and kneel with great assurance,
That we, more then his Pirotho•…, possess
The high throne in his heart.
I am not against your faith,
Yet I continue mine.
To thee no star be dark.
Both heaven and earth
Friend thee for ever.
All the good that may
Be wished upon thy head, I cry Amen too't.
Th'imparciall Gods, who from the mounted hey∣vans
View us their mortal Heard, behold who err,
And in their time chastise: go and find out
The bones of your dead Lords, and honour them
With treble Ceremony, rather then a gap
Should be in their dear rights, we would suppl'it.
But those we will depute, which shall invest
You in your dignities, and even each thing
Our hast does leave imperfect; So adieu
And heavens good eyes look on you. what are those?
Men of great quality, as may be judgd
By their appointment; Some of Thebs have told's
They are Sisters children, Nephews to the King.
By the Helm of Mars, I saw them in the war,
Like to a pair of Lions, smeard with prey,
Make lanes in troops aghast. I fixed my note
Constantly on them; for they were a mark
Worth a god's view: what prisoner was it that told me
When I enquired their names?
We leave, they are called
Arcite and Palamon,
Tic •…ight, those, those
They are not dead?
Nor in a state of life, had they bin taken
When their last hurts were given, it was possible
They might have bin r•…covered; Yet they breathe
And have the name of men.
Then like men use 'em
The very lees of such (millions of rates)
Exceed the wine of others. all our Surgeons
Convent in their behoof, our richest balms
Rather then niggard wast, their lives concern us,
Much more then Thebs is worth, rather then have 'em
Fre•…d of this plight, and in their morning state
(Sound and at libcrty) I would 'em dead,
But forty thousand fold, we had rather have 'em
Prisoners to us, then death; Bear 'em speedily
From ou•… kind air, to them unkind, and minister
What man •…o man may doe for our sake more,
Since I have known frights, fury, friends, behests,
Loves, provocations, zeal, a mistress Task,
Desire of liberty, a fever, madues,
Hath set a mark which nature could not reach too
Without some imposition, sickness in will
Or wrestling strength in reason, for our Love
And great Appollos mercy, all our best,
Their best skill tender. Lead into the City,
Where having bound things scattered, we will post Flourish.
To Athens for our Army.
Vrnes, and odours, bring away,
Vapours, sighs, darken the day;
Our dole more deadly looks than dying
Balms, and G•…mes, and heavy cheers,
〈◊〉 vials filled with tears,
And clamours through the wild ayre flying.
Come all sad, and solemn Shows,
That are queen•…-eyd pleasures foes;
We convent nought else but woes.
This funeral path, brings to your households grave:
Joy cease on you again: peace sleep with him.
And this to yours.
Yours this way: Heavenslend
A thousand differing ways, to one sure end.
This world's a City full of straying Streets,
And Death's the market place, where each one meets.
I may depart with little, while I live, some thing I
May cast to you, not much: Alas the Prison I
Keep, though it be for great ones, yet they seldom
Come; Before one Salmon, you shall take a number
Of Minnows: I am given out to be better lined
Then it can appear, to me report is a true
Speaker: I would I were really, that I am
Delivered •…o be: Marry, what I have (be it what
it will) I will aflure upon my daughter at
The day of my death.
Sir I demand no more then your own offer,
And I will estate your Daughter in what I
Have promised,
Well, we will talk more of this, when the solemnity
Is past; But have you a full promise of her?
When that shall be seen, I tender my consent.
I have Sir; here she comes.
Your Friend and I have ch•…nced to name
You here, upon the old business: But no more of that.
Now, so soon as the Court hurry is over, we will
Have an end of it: In•…h mean time look tenderly
To the two Prisoners. I can tell you they are princes.
These strewings are for their Chamber; tic pity they
Are in prison, and it were pity they should be out: I
Doe think they have patience to make any adversity
Ashamed; the prison it self is proud of 'em; and
They have all the world in their Chamber.
They are fa•…'d to be a pair of absolute men.
By my troth, I think Fame but stammers 'em, they doers.
Stand a greece above the reach of report.
I heard them reported in the Battle, to be the only
Nay most likely, for they are noble suffrers; I
Marvel how they would have looked had they been
Victors, that with such a constant Nobility, enforce
A freedom out of Bondage, making misery their
Mirth, and affliction, a toy to jest at.
Doe they so?
It seems to me they have no more sense of their
Captivity, then I of ruling Athens: they eat
Well, look merrily, discourse of many things,
But nothing of their own restraint, and disasters:
Yet sometime a divided sigh, martyrd as it were
In the deliverance, will break from one of them.
When the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke,
That I could wish my self a Sigh to be so chid,
Or at least a Sigher to be comforted.
I never saw'em.
The Duke himself came privately in the night, 
And so did they, what the reason of it is, I
Know not: Look yonder they are; that's
Arcite looks out.
No Sir, no, that's Palamon; Arcite is the
Lower of the twain; you may perceive a part
Of him.
Go too, leave your pointing; they would not
Make us their object; out of their sight.
It is a holiday to look on them: Lord, the
Difference of men. 
How doe you Noble Cousin?
How doe you Sir?
Why strong enough to laugh at misery,
And bear the chance of war yet, we are prisoners
I fear for ever Cousin.
I believe it,
And to that destiny have patiently
Laid up my hour to come.
Oh Cousin Arcite,
Where is Thebs now? where is our noble Country?
Where are our friend•…, and kindreds? never more
Must we behold those comforts, never see
The hardy youths strive for the Games of honour
(Hung with the painted favours of their Ladies)
Like tall Ships under sail: then start amongst 'em
And as an Eastwind leave 'em all behind us,
Like lazy Clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,
Even in the wagging of a wanton leg
Out-stript the peoples praises, won the Garlands,
Ere they have time to wish 'em ours. O never
Shall we two exercise, like Twins of honour,
Our Arms again, and feel our fyry horses
Like proud Seas under us, our good Swords, now
(Better the red-eyd god of war nev'r were)
Bravishd our sides, like age must run to rust,
And deck the Temples of those gods that hate us,
These hands shall never draw'em out like lightning
To blast whole Armies more.
No Palamon,
Those hopes are Prisoners with us, here we are
And here the graces of our youths must wither
Like a too-timely Spring; here age must find us,
And which is heaviest (Palamon) unmarried,
The sweet embraces of a loving wife
Laden with kisses, armed with thousand Cupids
Shall never clasp our necks, no issue know us,
No figures of our selves shall we ev'r see,
To glad our age, and like young Eagles teach'em
Boldly to gaze against bright arms, and say
Remember what your fathers were, and conquer.
The faire-eyd Maids, shall weep our Bauishments,
And in their Songs, curse ever-blinded fortune
Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done
To youth and nature; This is all our world;
We shall know nothing here but one another,
Hear nothing but the Clock that tells our woes.
The Vine shall grow, but we shall never see it:
Summer shall come, and with her all delights;
But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.
Tic too true Arcite. To out Theban hounds,
That shook the aged Foe: rest with their echoes,
No more now must we hello, no more shake
Our pointed Javelins, whilst the angry Swine
Flies like a parthian quiver from our rages,
Struck with our well-steeld Darts: All valiant uses,
(The soot, and nourishment of noble minds,)
In us two here shall perish; we shall die
(which is the curse of honour) lastly,
Children of grief, and Ignorance.
Yet Cousin,
Even from the bottom of these miseries
From all that fortune can inflict upon us,
I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,
If the gods please, to hold here abrave patience,
And the enjoying of our griefs together.
Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish
If I think this our prison.
Certainly,
Tic a maine goodness Cousin, that our fortunes
Were twined together; tic most true, two sou•…es
Put in two noble Bodies, let'em suffer
The gaul of hazard, so they grow together,
Will never sink, they must not, say they could,
A willing man dies sleeping, and ell's done.
Shall we make worthy uses of this place
That all men hate so much?
How gentle Cousin?
Let's think this prison, holy sanctuary,
To keep us from corruption of worse•… men,
We are young and yet desire the ways of honour,
That liberty and common Conversation
The poison of pure spirits; might like women
Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing
Can be but our Imaginations
May make it ours? And here being thus together,
We are an endless mine to one another;
We are one another wife, ever begotting
New births of love; we are father, f•…ends, acquaintance,
We are in one another, Families,
I am your heir, and you are mine: This place
Is our Inheritance: no hard Oppressor
Dare take this from us; here with a little patience
We shall live long, and loving: No surfeits seek us:
The hand of war •…urts none here, nor the Seas
Swallow their youth: we•…e we at liberty,
A wife might part us lawfully, or business,
Quarrels consume us, Envy of 〈◊〉 men
Crave our acquaintance, I might s•…ken Cousin,
Where you should never know it, and so perish
Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,
Or pra•…rs to the gods; a thousand chances
Were we from hence, would seaver 〈◊〉.
You have made me
(I thank you Cousin Arcit•…) almost wanton
With my Captivity: what a misery
It is to live abroad? and every where:
Tic like a Beast me thinks: I find the Court here,
I am sure a more content, and all those pleasures
That woo the wills of men to vanity,
I see through now, and am sufficient
To tell the world, tic but a gaudy shadow,
That old Time, as he passes by takes with him,
What had we bin old in the Court of Croon,
Where sin is Justice, lust, and ignorance,
The virtues of the great ones: Cousin Arcite,
Had not the loving gods found this place for us
We had died as they doe, ill old men, unwept,
And had their Epitaphs, the peoples Curses,
Shall I say more?
I would hear you still.
Ye shall.
Is there record of any two that loved
Better then we doe Arcite?
Sure there cannot.
I doe not think it possible our friendship
Should ever leave us.
Till our deaths it cannot 
And after death our spirits shall be led
To those that love eternally. Speak on Sir.
This garden has a world of pleasures in it.
What Flower is this?
Tic called Narcissus Madam.
That was a fair Boy certain, but a fool,
To love himself, were there not maids enough?
Pray forward.
Yes.
Or were they all hard hearted?
They could not be to one so fair.
Thou would not.
I think I should not, Madam.
That's a good wench:
But take heed to your kindness though.
Why Madam?
Men are mad things.
Will ye go forward Cousin?
Can not thou work: such flowers in silk wench?
Yes.
•…e have a gown full of 'em and of these,
This is a pretty colour, wilt not doe
Rarely upon a Skirt wench?
Dainty Madam.
Gosen, Cousin, how doe you Sir? Why Palamon?
Never till now I was in prison Arcite.
Why whats the matter Man?
Behold, and wonder.
By heaven she is a Goddess.
Ha.
Doe reverence.
She is a Goddess Arcite.
Of all Flowers.
Me thinks a Rose is best.
Why gentle Madam?
It is the very Emblem of a Maid.
For when the west wind courts her gently
How modestly she blows, and paints the Sun,
With her chaste blushes? When the North comes near her,
Rude and impatient, then, like Chastity
She lockes her beauties in her bud again,
And leaves him to base briers.
Yet good Madam,
Sometimes her modesty will blow so far
She false for it: a Maid
If she have any honour, would be loath
To take example by her.
Thou art wanton.
She is wondrous fair.
She is all the beauty extant.
The Sun grows high, lets walk in, keep these flowers,
Weal see how near Art can come near their colours;
I am wondrous merry hearted, I could laugh now.
I could lie down I am sure.
And take one with you?
That's as we bargain Madam,
Well, agree then.
What think you of this beauty?
Tic a rare one.
Is it but a rare one?
Yes a matchless beauty.
Might not a man well lose himself and love her?
I cannot tell what you have done, I have,
Beshrew mine eyes for it, now I feel my Shackles.
You love her then?
Who would not?
And desire her?
Be fore my liberty.
I saw her first.
That's nothing
But it shall be.
I saw her too.
Yes, but you must not love her.
I will not as you doe; to worship her;
As she is heavenly, and a blessed Gods;
(I love her as a woman, to enjoy her)
So both may love.
You shall not love at all.
Not love at all.
Who shall deny me?
I that first saw her; I that took possession
First with mine eye of all those beauties
In her reveled to mankind: if thou love her.
Or entertain a hope to blast my wishes,
Thou art a Traitor Arcite and a fellow
False as thy Title to her: friendship, blood
And all the ties between us I disclaim
If thou once think upon her.
Yes I love her,
And if the lives of all my name lay on it,
I must doe so, I love her with my soul,
If that will lose ye, faŕewell Palamon,
I say again, I love, and in loving her maintain
I am as worthy, and as free a lover
And have as just a title to her beauty
As any Palamon or any living
That is a mans Son.
Have I called thee friend?
Yes, and have found me so; why are you moved thus?
Let me deal coldly with you, am not I
Part of you blood, part of your soul? you have told me
That I was Palamon, and you were Arcite.
Yes.
Am not I liable to those affections,
Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall suffer?
Ye may be.
Why then would you deal so cunningly,
So strangely, so unlike a noble kinesman
To love alone? speak truly, doe you think me
Unworthy of her sight?
No, but unjust,
If thou pursue that sight.
Because an other
First sees the Enemy, shall I stand still
And let mine honour down, and never charge?
Yes, if he be but one.
But say that one
Had rather combat me?
Let that one say so,
And use thy freedom: else if thou pursue her,
Be as that cursed man that hates his Country,
A branded villain.
You are mad.
I must be.
Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me,
And in this madness, if I hazard thee
And take thy life, I dcale but truly.
Fie Sir.
You play the Child extremely: I will love her,
I must, I ought to doe so, and I dare,
And al, this justly.
O that now, that now
Thy false-sel•…e and thy friend, had but this fortune
To be one hour at liberty, and grasp
Our good Swords in our hands, I would quickly teach thee
What tw'er to filch affection from another:
Thou a•… baser in it then a Cutpurse;
Put but thy hey•… out of this window more,
And as I have a soul, Isle nail thy life too't.
I thou dare not fool, thou can not, thou art feeble.
Pu•… my head out? Isle throw my Body out,
And leap the garden, when I see her next 
And pitch between her arms to anger thee.
No more; the keeper's coming; I shall live
To k•…cke thy brains out with my Shackles.
Doe.
By your leave Gentlemen:
Now honest keeper?
Lord Arcite, you must presently to'th Duke;
The cause•… I know not yet.
I am ready keeper.
Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you
Of your fair Cousins Company.
And me too,
Even when you please of life; why is he sent for?
It may be he shall marry her, he's goodly.
And like enough the Duke hath taken notice
Both of his blood and body: But his falsehood,
Why should a friend be treacherous? If that
Get him a wife so noble, and so fair;
Let honest men ne'er love again. Once more
I would but see this fair One: Blessed Garden,
And fruit, and flowers more blessed that still blossom
As her brigh•… eyes shine on ye. would I were
For all the fortune of my life hereafter
Yon little Tree, yon blooming Apricot;
How I would spread, and fling my wanton arms
In at her window; I would bring her fruit
Fit for the Gods to feed on: youth and pleasure
Still as she tasted should be do•…bled on her,
And if she be not heavenly I would make her
So near the Gods in nature, they should fear her. 
And then I am sure she would love me: how now keeper
Wher's Arcite,
Banished: Prince Piritbous
Obtained his liberty; but never more
Upon his oath and life must he set foot
Upon this Kingdom.
Hes a blessed man,
He shall see Thebs again, and call to Arms
The bold young men, that when he bids 'em charge,
Fall on like fire: Arcit•… shall have a Fortune,
If he dare make himself a worthy Lover,
Yet in the Field to strike a bat•…le for her;
And if he lose her then, he's a cold Coward;
How brave•…lie may he bear himself to win her
If he be noble Arcite; thousand ways.
Were I at liberty, I would doe things
Of such a virtuous greatness, that this Lady,
This blushing virgin should take manhood to her
And seek to ravish me.
My Lord for you
I have this charge too.
To discharge my life.
No, but from this place to remo•…ve your Lordship,
The window•… are too open.
Devils take 'em
That are so envious to me; prithee kill me.
And hang for it afterword.
By this good light
Had I a sword I would kill thee.
Why my Lord?
Thou bring such pelting scurvy news continually
Thou art not worthy life•…; I will not go.
Indeed yon must my Lord.
May I see the garden?
No.
Then I am resolved, I will not go.
I must constrain you then; and for you are dange∣rous
Isle clap more irons on you.
Doe good keeper.
Isle shake'em so, ye shall not sl•…epe,
Isle make ye a new Morri•…e, must I go?
There is no remedy.
Fare well kind window.
May rude wind never hurt thee. O my Lady
If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,
Dream how I suffer. Come; now bury me.
Banished the kingdom? tic a benefit,
A mercy I must thank 'em for, but banished
The free enjoying of that face I die for,
Oh twasa stud died punishment, a death
Beyond Imagination: Such a vengeance
That were I old and wicked, all my sins
Could never pluck•… upon me. Palamon;
Thou hast the Start now, thou shalt stay and see
Her bright eyes break each morning against thy window,
And let in life into thee; thou shalt feed
Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty,
That nature nev'r exceeded, nor nev'r shall:
Good gods? what happiness has Palamon?
Twenty to one, he will come to speak to her,
And if she be as gentle, as she's fair,
I know she's his, he has a Tongue will tame
Tempe sts, and make the wild Rocks wanton. Come what can come'
The worst is death; I will not leave the Kingdom,
I know mine own, is but a heap of ruins,
And no redress there, if I go, he has her.
I am resolved an other shape shall make me,
Or end my fortunes. Either way, I am happy:
Isle see her, and be near her, or no more.
My Masters, isle be there that's certain.
And Isle be there.
And 〈◊〉.
Why then have with ye Boys; Tic but a chi•…ing,
Let the plough play to day, isle tick'lt out
Of the lades tails to morrow.
I am sure
To have my wife as jealous as a Turkey:
But that's all one, isle go through, let her mumble.
Clap her aboard to morrow night, and stoa her,
And ell's made up again.
I, doe but put a feskue in her fist, and you shall see her
Take a new lesson out, and be a good wench.
Doe we all hold, against the Maying?
Hold? what should ail us?
Arses will be there.
And Sennois.
And Rices, and 3. better lads nev'r danced under green Tree,
And yet know what wenches: ha?
But will the dainty Domino, the Schoolmaster keep touch
Doe you think: for he do's all ye know.
He will eat a hornebooke ere he fail: go too, the mat∣ter's too far driven between him, and the Tanners daugh∣la, to let slip now, and she must see the Duke, and she must da•…nce too.
Shall we be lusty.
All the Boys in Athens blow wind in the b•…ch on's,
and here isle be and there isle be, for our Town, and here again, and there again: ha, Boys, heigh for the wea∣verse.
This must be done in the woods.
O pardon me.
By any means our thing of learning sees so: where he himself will 〈◊〉 the Duke most pa•…ously in our behalfes: hes excellent in the woods, bring him to'th plains, his lear∣ning makes no cry:
Weal see the sports, then every man to's Tackle: and Sweet Companions lets rehearse by any means before The Ladies s•…e us, and doe sweetly, and God knows what May come on it.
Content; the sports once ended, we'll perform. Away Boys and hold.
By your leaves honest friends: pray you whither go•… you.
Whither? why, what a question's that?
Yes, tic a question, to me that know not.
To the Games my Friend.
Where were you bred you know it not?
Not farie Sir,
Are there such Gam•…s to day?
Yes marry are there:
And s•…ch as you never saw; The Duke himself
Will be in person there.
What pastimes are they?
Wrestling, and Running; Tic a pretty Fellow.
Thou wilt not go along.
Not yet Sir.
Well Sir
Take your own time, come Boys
My 〈◊〉 misgives me
This fellow has a veng'ance trick of the hip,
Mark how his Bodi's n•…de for it
Isle be hanged though
If he dare venture, hang him plumb porridge,
He wrestle? he roast eggs. Co•… lets be gon Lads.
This is an offered opportunity
I durst not wish for. Well, I could have wrestled,
The best men called it excellent, and run
Swifter, then wind upon a field of Corn
(Curling the wealthy ears) never flew: Il•… venture,
And in some poor disgu•…ze be there, who knows
Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands?
And happiness prefer me to a place,
Where I may ever dwell in sight of her.
Why should I love this Gentleman? Tic odds
He never will aff•…ct me; I am base,
My Father the mean Keeper of his Prison,
And he a prince; To marry him is hopeless;
To be his whore, is witless; Out upon it;
What pushes are we wenches driven to
When fifteen once has found us? First I saw him,
I (seeing) thought he was a goodly man;
He has as much to please a woman in him,
(If he please to bestow it so) as ever
These eyes yet looked on; Next, I pittled him,
And so would any young wench 〈◊◊〉
That ever dreamed, or vowed her Maidenhead
To a young hansom Man; Then I loved him,
(Extreme•…y loved him) infinitely loved him;
And yet he had a Cousin, fair as he too.
But in my heart was Palamon, and there
Lord, what a coil he keeps? To hear him
Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is?
And yet his Songs are sad-ones; Fairer spoken,
Was never Gentleman. When I come in
To bring him water in a morning, first
He bows his noble body, then salutes me, thus:
Fair, gentle May de, good morrow, may thy goodness,
Get thee a happy husband; Once he kissed me,
I loved my lips the better ten days after,
Would he would doe so every day; He grieves much,
And me as much to see his misery.
What should I doe, to make him know I love him,
For I would fine enjoy him? Say I ventured
To set him free? what says the law then? Thus much
For Law, or kindred: I will doe it,
And this night, or to morrow he shall love me.
You have done worthily: I have not seen
Since Hercules, a man of tougher sinews;
What ere you are, you run the best, and wrestle,
That these times can allow.
I am proud to please you.
What Country bred you?
This; but far off, Prince.
Are you a Gentleman?
My father said so;
And to those gentle uses gave me life.
Are you his heir?
His youngest Sir.
Your Father
Sure is a happy Sire then: what proves you?
A little of all noble Qualities:
I could have kept a Hawk, and well have holloa'd
To a deep cry of Dogs; I dare not praise
My feat in horsemanship: yet they that knew me
Would say it was my best piece: last, and greatest,
I would be thought a Soldier.
You are perfect.
Upon my soul, a proper man.
He is so.
How doe you like him Lady?
I admire him,
I have not seen so young a man, so noble
(If he say true,) of his sort.
Believe,
His mother was a wondrous handsome woman,
His face me thinks, goes that way.
But his Body
And fiery mind, illustrate a brave Father.
Mark how his virtue, like a hidden Sun
Breaks through his baser garments.
Hoe's well got sure.
What made you seek this place Sir?
Noble Theseus.
To purchase name, and doe my ablest service
To such a well-found wonder, as thy worth,
Foe only in thy Court, of all the world
dwells faire-eyd honour.
All his words are worthy.
Sir, we are much indebted to your travel,
Nor shall you loose your wish: Perithous
Dispose of this fair Gentleman.
Thanks Theseus.
What ere you are you're mine, and I shall give you
To a most noble service, to this Lady,
This bright young Virgin; pray observe her goodness;
You have honoured his fair birth-day, with your virtues,
And as your due you're hers: kiss her fair hand Sir.
Sir, you're a noble Giver: dearest Beauty,
Thus let me seal my vowed faith: when your Servant
(Your most unworthy Creature) but offends you,
Command him die, he shall.
That were too cruel.
If you deserve well Sir; I shall soon see it:
You're mine, and somewhat better than your rank Isle use you.
Isle see you furnished, and because you say
You are a horseman, I must needs entreat you
This after noon to ride, but tic a rough one.
I like him better (Prince) I shall not then
Freeze in my Saddle.
Sweet, you must be ready,
And you Emilia, and you (Friend) and all
To morrow by the Sun, to doe observance
To flowery May, in Deans wood: waite well Sir
Upon your Mistress: Emily, I hope
He shall not go a foot.
That were a shame Sir,
While I have horses: take your choice, and what
You want at any time, let me but know it;
If you serve faithfully, I dare assure you
You'll find a loving Mi•…ris.
If I doe not,
Let me find that my Father ever hated,
〈◊〉, and blows.
Go lead the way; you have won it:
It shall be so; you shall receive all dues
Fit for the honour you have won; It were wrong else,
Sister, beshrew my heart, you have a Servant,
That if I were a woman, would be Master,
But you are wise.
I hope too wise for that Sir.
Let all the Dukes, and all the devils roar,
He is at liberty: I have ventured for him,
And out I have brought him to a little wood
A mile hence, I have sent him, where a Cedar
Higher than all the rest, spreads like a plane
Fast by a Brooke, and there he shall keep close,
Till I provide him Files, and food, for yet
His iron bracel•…ts are not off. O Love
What a stout hearted child thou art! My Father
Durst better have endured cold iron, than done it:
I love him, beyond love, and beyond reason,
Or wit, or safety: I have made him know it
I care not, I am desperate, If the law
Find me, and then condemn me for it; some wenches,
Some honest hearted Maids, will sing my Dirge.
And tell to memory, my death was noble,
Dying almost a Martyr: That way he takes,
I purpose is my way too: Sure he cannot
Be so unmanly, as to leave me here,
If he doe, Maids will not so easily
Trust men again: And yet he has not thanked m•…
For what I have done: no not so much as kissed me,
And that (me thinks) is not so well; not scarcely
Could I persuade him to become a Freeman,
He made such scruples of the wrong he did
To me, and to my Father. Yet I hope
When he considers more, this love of mine
Will take more root within him: Let him doe
What he will with me, so he use me kindly,
For use me so he shall, or isle proclaim him
And to his face, no-man: Isle presently
Provide him necessaries, and pack my clothes up,
And where there is a path of ground Isle venture
So h•… be with me; By him, like a shadow
Isle ever dwell; 〈◊〉 bin thy•… hour the whoobub
Will be all ore the prison: I am then
Kissing the man they look for: farewell Father;
Get many more such prisoners, and such daughters,
And shortly you may keep your self. No•… to him:
The Duke has lost Hypolita; each took
A several land. This is a solemn Right
They owe bloomed May, and the Athenians pay it
To'th heart of Ceremony: O Queen Emilia
Fresher then May, sweeter
Then his gold Buttons on the bows, or all
Th'en amelld knackes of the Mead, or garden, yea
(We challenge too) the bank of any Nymph
That makes the stream seem flowers; thou o Jewel
Of the wood, of the world, hast likewise blessed a pace
With thy sole presence, in thy rumination
That I poor man might eftsoones come between
And chop on some cold thought, thrice blessed chance
To drop on such a Mistress, expectation
most guiltless on it: tell 〈◊〉 O Lady Fortune
(Next after Emily •…y Sove•…gne) how far
I may be proud. She takes strong note of me,
Hath made me near her; and this benteous Morn
(The prim'st of all the year) presents me with
A brace of horses, two such Steeds might well
Be by a pair of Kings backed, in a Field
That their crowns titles tried: Alas, alas
Poor Cousin Palamon, poor prisoner, thou
So lit•…le dream upon my fortune, that
Thou think thy self, the happier thing, to be
So near Emilia, me thou deem at Thebs,
And therein wretched, although free; But if
Thou knew my Mistress breathed on me, and that
I eared her language, lived in her eye; O Cos
What passion would enclose thee.
Traitor kinseman,
Thou should perceive my passion, if these signal
Of prisonment were off me, and this hand
But owner of a Sword: By all oaths in one
I, and the justice of my love would make thee
A conf•… Traitor, o thou most persidious
That ever gently looked the voids of honour.
That eu'r bore gentle Token; falsest Cousin
That ever blood made kin, call thou his thine?
Isle prove it in my Shackles, with these hands,
Void of appointment, that thouly'st, and art
A very thief in love, a Ch•…y Lord
Nor worth the name of villain: had I a Sword
And these house clogs away.
Dear Cousin Palamon,
Cosoner Arcite, give me language, such
As thou hast showed me feat.
Not •…ding in
The circuit of my breast, any gross stuff
To form me like your blazon, holds me to
This gentleness of answer; tic your passion
That thus mistakes, the which to you being enemy,
Cannot to me be kind: honour, and honesty
I cherish, and depend on, how so ev'r
You skip them in me, and with them fair Cos
Isle maintain my proceedings; pray be pleased
To show in generous terms, your griefs, since that
Your question's with your equal, who professes
To clear his own way, with the mind and Sword
Of a true Gentleman.
That thou durst Arcite.
My Cos, my Cos, you have been well advertised
How much I dare, you've seen me use my Sword
Against th'advice of fear: sure of another
You would not hear me doubted, but your silence
Should break out, though in the Sanctuary.
Sir,
I have seen you move in such a place, which well
Might justify your manhood, you were called
A good knight and a bold; But the whole weeke's not fair
If any day it rain: Their valiant temper
Men loose when they incline to treachery,
And then they fight like compelled Bears, would fly
Were they not tide.
Kinsman, you might as well
Speak this, and act it in your Glass, as to
His care, which now disdains you.
Come up to me,
Q•…it me of these cold Gives, give me a Sword
Though it be rusty, and the charity
Of one meal lend me; Come before me then
A good Sword in thy hand, and doe but say
That Emily is thine, I will forgive
The trespass thou hast done me, yea my life
If then thou carry•…, and brave souls in shades
That have died manly, which will seek of me
Some news from earth, they shall get none but this
That thou art brave, and noble.
Be content,
Again betake you to your hawthorn house,
With counsel of the night, I will be here
With wholesome viands; these impediments
Will I file off, you shall have gannents, and
Perfumes to kill the •…nil of the prison, after
When you shall stretch your self, and say but Arcite
I am in plight, there shall be at your choice
Both Sword, and Armour.
Oh you heavens, dares any
So noble bear a guilty business! none
But only Arcite, therefore none but Arcite
In this kind is so bold.
Sweet Palamon.
I doe embràce you, and your offer, for
Your offer do it I only, Sir your person
Without hypocrisy I may not wish 
More then my Swords edge ont.
You hear the Horns;
Enter your Music least this match between's
Be crossed, er met, give me your hand, farewell.
Isle bring you every needful thing: I pray you
Take comfort and be strong.
Pray hole•… your promise;
And doe the deed with a bent brow, most creaine
You love me not, be rough with me, and power
This oil out of your language; by this ayre
I could for each word, give a Cuff: my stomach
not reconcild by reason,
Plainly spoken,
Yet pardon me hard language, when I spur 
My horse, I chide him nor; content, and anger
In me have but one face. Hark Sir, they call
The scattered to the Banquet; you must guess
I have an office there.
Sir your attendance
Cannot please heaven, and I know your office
Unjustly is achieved.
If a good title,
I am persuaded this question sick between's,
By bleeding must be cured. I am a Suitor,
That to your Sword you will be queath this plea,
And talk of it no more.
But this one word:
You are going now to gaze upon my Mistress,
For note you, mine she is.
Nay then.
Nay pray you,
You talk of feeding me to breed me strength
You are going now to look upon a Sun
That strengthens what it looks on, there
You have a vantage ore me, but enjoy't till
I may enforce my remedy. Farewell.
He h•…s mistook; the Beak I meant, is gone
After his fancy, Tic now well-nigh morning,
No matter, would it were perpetual night,
And darkness Lord of the world, Hark tic a woolfe:
In me hath grief slain fear, and but for one thing
I care for nothing, and that's Palamon.
I wreak not if the wolves would jaw me, so
He had this File; what if I hallowd for him?
I cannot hallow: ifI whooped; what then?
If he not answered, I should call a wolf,
And doe him but that service. I have heard
Strange howls this live-long night, why may it not be
They have made prey of him? he has no weapons,
He cannot run, the Jangling of his Gives
Might call fell things to listen, who have in them
A sense to know a man unarmed, and can
Smell where resistance is. Isle set it down
He's torn to pieces, they howl many together
And then they feed on him: So much for that,
Be bold to ring the Bell; how stand I then?
Ell's char'd when he is gone, No, no Ely,
My Father's to be hanged for his escape,
My self to beg, if I prized life so much
As to deny my act, but that I would not,
Should I try death by dussons: I am mop't,
Food took I none these two days.
Sipped some water. I have not closed mine eyes
Save when my lids scowrd off their bine; alas
Dissolve my life, Let not my sense unsettle
Least I should drown, or stab, or hang my self,
O state of Nature, fail together in me,
Since thy best props are warped: So which way now?
The best way is, the next way to a grave:
Each errant step beside is torment. Lo
The Moon is down, the Crickets chirp, the Schreichowl
Calls in the dawn; all offices are done
Save what I fail in: But the point is this
An end, and that is all.
I should be near the place, hoe. Cousin Palamon.
Arcite.
The same: I have brought you food and files,
Come forth and fear not, her'e sno Theseus.
Nor none so honest Arcite.
That's no matter,
We'll argue that hereafter: Come take courage,
You shall not dye thus beastly, here Sir drink
I know you are faint, then isle talk further with you.
Arcite, thou might now poison me.
I might.
But I must fear you first: Sit down, and good now
No more of these vain parleys; let us not
Having our ancient reputation with us
Make talk for Fools, and Cowards, To your health, &amp;c.
Doe.
Pray sit down then, and let me entreat you
By all the honesty and honour in you,
No mention of this woman, t'will di•…urbe us,
We shall have time enough.
Well Sir, Isle pledge you.
Drink a good hearty draught, it breeds good blood man.
Doe not you feel it thaw you?
Stay, 〈◊〉 t•…ll you after a draught or two more.
Spare it not, the Duke has more Cousin: Eat now.
Yes.
I am glad you have so good a stomach.
I am gladder I have so good meat too't.
Is it not mad lodging here in the wild woods Cousin
Yes, for then that have wilde Consciences.
How tastes your vittails? your hunger needs no sauce I see,
Not much.
But if it did, yours is too 〈◊〉: sweet Cousin: what is this?
Venison.
Tic a lusty meat:
Give me more wine; here Arcite to the wenches
We have known in our days. The Lord Stewards daughter.
Doe you remember her?
After you Cousin.
She loved a black-haired man.
She did so; well Sir.
And I have heard some call him Arcite. and
Out with it faith.
She met him in an Arbour:
What did she there Cousin? play of the virginals?
Something she did Sir.
Made her groan a month for it; or 2. or 3. or 10.
The Marshals Sister,
Had her share too, as I remember Coffin,
Else there be tales abroad, you'll pledge her?
Yes.
A pre•…tie brown wench t'is-There was a time
When young men went a hunting, and a wood,
And a broad Beech: and thereby hangs a tale: heigh ho.
For Emily, upon my life; Fool
Away with this strained mirth; I say again
That sigh was breathed for Emily; base Cousin,
Dare thou break first?
you are wide.
By heaven and earth, ther's nothing in thee honest.
Then Isle leave you: you are a Beast now:
As thou makst me, Traitor.
Ther's all things needful, files and shirts, and, per∣fumes:
Isle come again some two hours hence, and bring
That that shall quiet all,
A Sword and Armour.
Fear me not; you are now too foul; fare well.
Cet off your Trinkets, you shall want nought;
Sir ha:
Isle hear no more.
If he keep touch, he dies for it.
I am very cold, and all the Stars are out too,
The little Stars, and all, that look like aglets:
The Sun has seen my Folly: Palam•…n;
Alas no; hes i•… heaven; where am I now?
Yonder's the sea, and ther's a Ship; how't tumbles
And ther's a Rock lies watching under water;
Now, now, it beats upon it; now, now, now,
Ther's a leak sprung, a sound one, how they cry?
Upon her before the wind, you'll loose all else:
Up with a course or two, and take about Boys.
Good night, good night, you're gon•…; I am very hungry,
Would I could find a fine 〈◊〉 would tell me
〈◊〉 from all parts of the world, then would I make
A Carrack of a Cockle shell, and sail
By east and North East to the King of Pigmes,
For he tells fortunes rarely. Now my Father
Twenty to one is trust up in a trice
To morrow morning, Isle say never a word.
For isle cut my 〈◊〉 coat, 〈◊〉 above my knee,
And isle clip my yellow lockes; an inch below mine eye. hey, nonny, nonny, nonny,
He's buy me a white Cut, forth for to ride
And isle go seek him, throw the world that is so wide hey nonny, nonny, nonny.
O for a prick now like a Nightingale, to put my breast
Against. I shall sleep like a Top else.
Fie, fie, what tediosity, &amp; disensanity is here among ye? have my Rudiments bin bi•…abourd so long with ye? milkd unto ye, and by a figure even the very plumbroth &amp; marrow of my understanding laid upon ye? and do you still cry where, and how, &amp; wherefore? you most course freeze capacities, ye jave Judgements, have I said thus let be, and there let be, and then let be, and no man understand me, proh 〈◊〉, medius 〈◊〉, ye are all dunces: For why here stand I. Here the Duke comes, there are you close in the Thicket; the Duke appears, I meet him and unto him I utter learned things, and many figures, he hears, and nods, and hums, and then cries rare, and I go forward, at length I fling my Cap up; mark there; then do you as once did M•…ager, and the Bore break comely out before him: like true lovers, cast your selves in a Body decently, and sweetly, by a figure trace, and turn Boys.
And sweetly we will doe it Master Gerrold.
Draw up the Company, Whore's the Taborour.
Why Timothy.
Here my mad boys, have at ye.
But I say whore's their women?
Here's Frizz and Maudlin.
And little Luce with the white legs, and bouncing 〈◊〉.
And freekeled Nel; that never failed her Master.
Where be your Ribands maid•…? swim with your Bodies
And carry it sweetly, and deliverly
And now and then a favour, and a frisko.
Let us alone Sir.
Wher's the rest of the Music.
Dispersed as you commanded.
Couple then
And see what's wanting; wher's the Bavian?
My friend, carry your tail without offence
•…r scandal to the Ladies; and be sure
〈◊〉 tumble with audacity, and manhood,
And when you bark doe it with judgement.
Yes Sir.
Quo usque tandem. Here is a woman wanting
We may go whistle: all the fat's in the fi•…e.
We have,
As learned Authors utter, washd a Tile,
We have been fatu•…, and laboured vainly.
This is that scornful piece, that 〈◊〉 vi hilding
That gave her promise faithfully, she would be here,
Cice y the Sempsters daughter:
The next gloves that I give her shall be dog skin;
Nay and she fail me once, you can tell Arses
She swore by wine, and bread, she would not break.
An Eel and woman,
A learned Poet says: unless by the tail
And with thy teeth thou hold, will either fail,
In manners this was false position
A fire ill take her; do's she flinch now?
What
Shall we determine Sir?
Nothing,
Our business is become a nullity
Yea, and a woeful, and a piteous nullity.
Now when the credit of our Town lay on it,
Now to be frampall, now to peace of the nettle,
Go thy ways, isle remember thee, isle fit thee,
The George allow, came from the South, from
The coast of Barberry a.
And there he met with brave gallants of war By one, by two, by three, a
Well held well held, you jolly gallants,
And whither now are you bound a
O let me have your company till come to the sound a
There was three fools, fell out about an howls
The one sed it was an owl
The other he sed nay,
The third he sedit was a hawk, and her bells were cut away.
Ther's a dainty mad woman Mr. comes in the Nick as mad as a march hare: if wee can get her dance, wee are made again: I warrant her, she'll doe the rarest gambols.
A mad woman? we are made Boys.
And are you mad good woman?
I would be sorry else,
Give me your hand.
Why?
I can tell your fortune.
You are a fool: rell ten, I have post him: Buzz
Friend you must eat no white bread, if you doe
Your teeth will bleed extremely, shall we dance ho?
I know you, y'a•… a Tinker: Sirha Tinker
Stop no more holes, but what you should.
Dij bone. A Tinker Damsel?
Or a Conjurer: raise me a devil now, and let him play
of the bells and bones.
Go take her, and fluently persuade her to a peace:
Et opus exegi, quote nec 〈◊〉 ira, 〈◊〉 ignis.
Strike up, and lead her in.
Come Lasle, lets trip it.
Isle lead:
Doe, doe.
Persuasively, and cunningly: away boys, 
I hear the horns: give me some
Meditation, and mark your Cuo:
Pallas inspire me.
This way the Stag took.
Stay, and edisie.
What have we here?
Some Country sport, upon my life Sir.
Well Sir, go forward, we will 〈◊〉.
Ladies sit down, we'll 〈◊◊〉.
Thou doughty Duke all hail: •…ll hail sweet Ladies.
This is a cold beginning.
If you but favour; our Country pastime made is,
We are a few of those collected here
That ruder Tongues distinguish villager,
And to say verity, and not to fable;
We are a merry rout, or else a rabble
Or company, or by a figure, Choris
That fore thy dignity will dance a Morris.
And I that am the rectifier of all
By title Pedagogus, that let fall
The Birch upon the breeches of the small ones,
And humble with a 〈◊〉 the tall ones,
Doe here present this Machine, or this fra•…e,
And dainty Duke, whose doughty dis•…all fame
From Dis to Dedal•…, from post to pillar
Is blown abroad; help me thy poor well willer,
And with thy twins•…ing eyes, look right and straight
Upon this mighty 〈◊〉 — of mickle weight
Is — now comes in, which being glewd together
Makes Morris, and the cause that we came •…ether.
The body of our sport of no small study
I first appear, though rude, and raw, and muddy,
To speak before thy noble grace, this te•…er:
At whose great feet I offer up •…y penner.
The next the Lord of May, and Lady bright,
The Chambermaid, and Serving-man by night
That seek out sell•…t •…ging: Then mine Host
And his fat Spouse, that welcomes to their cost
The gauled Traveller, and with a beckoning
Informs the Tipster to inflame the reckoning:
Then the beast eating Clown, and next the fool,
The Bavian with long tail, and eke long 〈◊〉,
Cummultis aliijs that make a dance,
Say I, and all shall presently advance.
I, I by any mea•…s, dear Domino.
Produce. 
〈◊◊〉, Come forth, and foot it,
Ladies, if we have been •…erry
And have pleased thee with a derry,
And a 〈◊〉, 〈◊〉 a 〈◊〉
Say the Schoolemaster's no Clown:
Duke, if we have pleased three 〈◊〉
And have done as good Boys should doe,
Give us but a tree or twain
For a Maypole, and again
Ere another year run out,
We'll make thee laugh and all this 〈◊〉.
Take 20. D•…mine; how does my sweet heart.
Never so pleased Sir.
It was an excellent dance, and for a preface
I never heard a better.
Schoolmaster, I thank yo•…, One see'•… all re∣warded.
And heir's something to paint your Pole withal.
Now to our sports again.
May the Stag thou 〈◊〉 stand long,
And thy dogs be swift and strong:
May they kill him withoutlets,
And the Ladies •…ate his dows•…ts: Come we are all •…de. 
Dij Dea{que} omnes, ye have danced rarely wenches. 
About this hour my Cousin gave his faith
To visit me again, and with him bring
Two Swords, and two good Armours; if he fail
He's neither man, nor Soldier; when he left 〈◊〉
I did not think a week could have restored
My lost strength to me, I was grown so low,
And Crestfallen with my wants: I thank thee Arcite,
Thou art yet a fair Foe; and I feel my self
With this refreshing, able once again
To out dure danger: To delay it longer
Would make the world think when it comes to hearing,
That I lay fatting like a Swine, to fight
And not a Soldier: Therefore this blessed morning
Shall be the last; and that Sword he refuses,
If it but hold, I kill him with; tic Justice:
So love, and Fortune for me: O good morrow. 
Good morrow noble kinesman,
I have put you
To too much pains Sir.
That too much fair Cousin.
Is but a debt to honour, and my duty.
Would you were so in all Sir; I could wish ye
As kind a kinsman, as you force me find
A beneficial foe, that my embraces
Might thank ye, not my blows.
I shall think either
Well done, a noble recompense.
Then I shall quit you.
Defy me in these fair terms, and you show
More then a Mistress to me, no more anger
As you love any thing that's honourable;
We were not bred to talk man, when we are armed
And both upon our guards, then let our fury
Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us,
And then to whom the birthright of this Beauty
Truly pertains (without obbraidings, scorns,
Dispisings of our persons, and such pouting•…
Fitter for Girls and Schooleboyes) will be seen
And quickly, you•…s, or mine: wilt please you arm Sir,
Or if you feel your self not sitting yet
And furnished with your old strength, isle stay Cousin
And every day discourse you into health,
As I am spared, your person I am friends with,
And I could wish I had not said I loved her
Though I had did; But loving such a Lady
And justifying my Love, I must not fly from it.
Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy
That no man but thy Cosen's fit to kill thee,
I am well, and lusty, choose your Arms.
Choose you Sir:
Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou doe it
To make me •…pare thee?
If you think so Cousin,
You are deceived, for as I am a Soldier.
I will not spare you.
That's well said.
You'll find it
Then as I am an honest man and love,
With all the justice of affection
Isle pay thee soundly: This isle take.
That's mine then,
Isle are•…e you first.
Do: pray thee tell me Cousin,
Where gotst thou this good Armour.
Tic the Dukes,
And to say true, I stole it; doe I pinch you.
No.
Is it not too heavy?
I have worn a lighter,
But I shall make it serve.
Isle buckle it close.
By any means.
You care not for a Grand guard?
No, no, we'll use no horses, I perceive
You would fine be at that Fight.
I am indifferent.
Faith so am I: good Cousin, thrust the buckle
Through far enough.
I warrant you.
My Cask now.
Will you fight bare-armed?
We shall be the no•…bler.
But use your Gauntlets though; those are of the least,
Prithee take mine good Cousin.
Thank you Arcite.
How doe I look, am I fallen much away?
Faith very little; love has used you kindly.
Isle warrant thee, Isle strike home.
Doe, and spare not;
Isle give you cause sweet •…ocean.
Now to you Sir,
Me thinks this Armours very like that, 〈◊〉,
Thou wor'st that day the 3. Kings fell, but lighter.
That was a very good one, and that day
I well remember, you out did me Cousin,
I never saw such valour: when you charged
Upon the left wing of the Enemy,
I spurt hard to come up, and under me
I had a right good horse.
You had indeed
A bright Bay I remember.
Yes but all
Was vainly laboured in me, you outwent me,
Nor could my wishes reach you; yet a little
I did by imitation.
More by virtue,
You are modest Cousin.
When I saw you charge first,
Me thought I heard a dreadful clap of Thunder
Break from the Troop.
But still before that flew
The lightning of your valour: Stay a little,
Is not this piece too 〈◊〉?
No, no, tic well.
I would have nothing hurt thee but my Sword,
A bruise would be dishonour.
Now I am perfect.
Stand off then.
Take my Sword, I hold it better.
I thank ye: No, keep it, your life lies on it,
Here's one, if it but hold, I ask no more,
For all my hopes: My Cause and honour guard me.
And me my love: * Is there ought else to say?
This only, and no more: Thou art mine Aunts Son.
And that blood we desire to shed is mutual,
In me, thine, and in thee, mine: My Sword
Is in my hand, and if thou killst me
The gods, and I forgive thee; If there be
A place prepared for those that sleep in honour,
I wish his weary soul, that falls may win it:
Fight bravely Cos•…, give me thy noble hand.
Here Palamon: This hand shall never more
Come near thee with such friendship.
I commend thee.
If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,
For none but such, dare die in these just Trials.
Once more farewell my Cousin,
Farewell Arcite.
Lo Cousin, lo, our Folly has undone us.
Why?
This is the Duke, a hunting as I told you,
If we be found, we are wretched, O retire
For honours sake, and safely presently
Into your Bush again; Sir we shall find
Too many hours to dye in, gentle Cousin:
If you be seen you perish instantly
For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,
For my contempt; Then all the world will scorn us,
And say we had a noble difference,
But base disposers of it.
No, no, Cousin
I will no more be hidden, nor put off
This great adventure to a second Trial
I know your cunning, and I know your cause,
He that faints now, shame take him, put thy self
Upon thy present guard.
You are not mad?
Or I will make th'advantage of this hour
Mine own, and what to come shall threaten me,
I fear less then my fortune: know weak Cousin
I love Emilia, and in that isle bury
Thee, and all crosses else.
Then come, what can come
Thou shalt know Palamon, I dare as well
Die, as discourse, or sleep: Only this fears me,
The law will have the honour of our ends.
Have at thy •…ife.
Look to thine own well Arcite.
What ignorant and mad malicious Traitors,
Are you? That against the tenor of my Laws
Are making Battle, thus like Knights appointed,
Without my leave, and Officers of Arms?
By Castor both shall dye.
Hold thy word Theseus,
We are certainly both Traitors, both despisers
Of thee, and of thy goodness: I am Palamon
That cannot love thee, he that broke thy Prison,
Think well, what that deserves; and this is Arcite
A bolder Traitor never trod thy ground
A Falser neu'r seemed friend: This is the man
Was begged and banished, this is he contemns thee
And what thou dare doe; and in this disguise
Against this own Edict follows thy Sister,
That fortunate bright Star, the fair Emilia
Whose servant, (if there be a right in seeing,
And first bequeathing of the soul to) justly
I am, and which is more, dares think her his.
This treachery like a most trusty Lover,
I called him now to answer; if thou be
As thou art spoken, great and virtuous,
The true descider of all injuries,
Say, Fight again, and thou shalt see me Theseus
Doe such a Justice, thou thy self wilt envy,
Then take my life, Isle woo thee too't.
O heaven,
What more then man is this!
I have sworn.
We seek not
Thy breath of mercy Theseus, Tic to me
A thing as soon to dye, as thee to say it,
And no more moved: where this man calls me Traitor,
Let me say thus much; if in love be Treason,
In service of so excellent a Beauty,
As I love most, and in that faith will perish,
As I have brought my life here to confirm it,
As I have served her truest, worthiest,
As I dare kill this Cos•…, that denies it,
So let me be most Traitor, and ye please me:
For scorning thy Edict Duke, ask that Lady
Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me
Stay here to love her; and if she say Traitor,
I am a villain fit to lye unburied.
Thou shalt have pity of us both, o Theseus,
If unto neither thou show mercy, stop,
(As thou art just) thy noble ear against us,
As thou art valiant; for thy Cousins soul
Whose 12. strong labours crown his memory,
Lets die together, at one instant Duke,
Only a little let him fall before me,
That I may tell my Soul he shall not have her.
I grant your wish, for to say true, your Cousin
Has ten times more offended, for I gave him
More mercy then you found, Sir, your offences
Being no more then his: None here speak for'em
For ere the Sun set, both shall sleep for ever.
Asas the pity, now or never Sister
Speak not to be denied; That face of yours
Will bear the curses else of after ages
For these lost Cousins.
In my face dear Sister
I find no anger to 'em; nor no ruin,
The missed venture of their own eyes kill'em;
Yet that I will be woman, and have pity,
My knees shall grow to'th ground but Isle get mercy.
Help me dear Sister, in a deed so virtuous,
The powers of all women will be with us,
Most royal Brother.
Sir by our tie of Marriage.
By your own spotless honour.
By that faith,
That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me.
By that you would have pity in another,
By your own virtues infi•…ite.
By valour,
By all the chaste nights I have ever pleased you.
These are strange Conjurings.
Nay then I•…o in too: By all our friendship Sir, by all our dangers,
By all you love most, wars; and this sweet Lady.
By that you would have trembled to deny
A blushing Maid.
By your own eyes: By strength
In which you swore I went beyond all women,
Almost all men, and yet I yielded Theseus.
To crown all this; By your most noble soul
Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first.
Next hear my prayers.
Last let me entreat Sir.
For mercy.
Mercy.
Mercy on these Princes.
Ye make my faith reels: Say I felt
Comp•…ssion to'em both, how would you place it?
Upon their lives: But with their banishments.
You are a right woman Sister; you have pity,
B•…t want the understanding where to use it.
If you desire their lives, invent a way
Safer then banishment: Can these two live
And have•… the agony of love about 'em,
And not kill one another? Every day
The'yld fight about you; hourly bring your honour
In public question with their Swords; Be wise then
And here forget 'em; it concerns your credit,
And my oath equally: I have said they die,
Better they fall by the law, then one another.
Bow not my honour.
O my noble Brother,
That oath was rashly made, and in your anger,
Your reason will not hold it, if such vows
Stand for express will, all the world must perish.
Beside, I have another oath, against yours
Of more authority, I am sure more love,
Not made in passion neither, but good heed.
What is it Sister?
Urge it home brave Lady.
That you would nev'r deny me any thing
Fit for my modest suit, and your free granting:
I tie you to your word now, if ye fall in it,
Think how you maim your honour;
(For now I am set a begging Sir, I am deaf
To all but your compassion) how their lives
Might breed the ruin of my name; Opinion,
Shall any thing that loves me perish for me?
That were a cruel wisdom, doe men proyne
The straight young Bows that blush with thousand Blossom•…
Because they may be rotten? O Duke Theseus
The goodly Mothers that have groaned for these,
And all the longing Maids that ever loved,
If your vow stand, shall curse me and my Beauty,
And in their funeral songs, for these two Cousins
Despise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,
Till I am nothing but the scorn of women;
For heavens sake save their lives, and banish 'em.
On what conditions?
Sweare'em never more
To make me their Contention, or to know me,
To tread upon thy Duke dome, and to be
Where ever they shall travel, ever strangers to one another.
Isle be cut a pieces
Before I take this oath, forget I love her?
O all ye gods despise me then: Thy Banishment
I not mislike, so we may fairly carry
Our Swords, and cause along: else never trifle,
But take our lives Duke, I must love and will,
And for that love, must and dare kill this Cousin
On any piece the earth has.
Will you Arcite
Take these conditions?
H'es a villain then.
These are men.
No, never Duke: Tic worse to me than begging
To take my life so basely, though I think
I never shall enjoy her, yet isle preserve
The honour of affection, and dye for her,
Make death a Devil.
What may be done? for now I feel compassion.
Let it not fall again Sir.
Say Emilia
If one of them were dead, as one mu•…, are you
Content to take the other to your husband?
They cannot both enjoy you; They are Princes
As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble
As ever fame yet spoke of; look upon'em,
And if you can love, end this difference,
I give consent, are you content too Princes?
With all our souls.
He that she refuses
Must dye then.
Any death thou can invent Duke.
If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favour,
And Lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.
If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,
And Soldiers sing my Epitaph.
Make choice then.
I cannot Sir, they are both too excellent
For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.
What will become of 'em?
Thus I ordain it,
And by mine honour, once again it stands,
Or both shall dye. You shall both to your Country,
And each within this mo•…eth accompanied
With three fair Knights, appear again in this place,
In which Isle plant a Pyramid; and whether
Before us that are here, can force his Cousin
By fair and knightly strength to touch the Pillar,
He shall enjoy her: the other loose his head,
And all his friends; Nor shall he grudge to fall,
Nor think he dies with interest in this Lady:
Will this content ye?
Yes: here Cousin Arcite
I am friends again, till that hour.
I embrace ye.
Are you content Sister?
Yes, I must Sir,
Else both miscarry.
Come shake hands again then,
And take •…eede, as you are Gentlemen, this Quarrel
Sleep till the hour prefixed, and hold your course,
We dare not fail thee Theseus.
Come, Isle give ye
Now usage like to Princes, and to Friends:
When ye return, who wins, Isle settle here,
Who looses, yet Isle weep upon his Beer. 
Hear you no more, was nothing said of me
Concerning the escape of Palamon?
Good Sir remember.
Nothing that I heard,
For I came home before the business
Was fully ended: Yet I might perceive
Ere I departed, a great likelihood
Of both their p•…rdons: For Hipolita,
And faire-eyd Emily, upon their knees
Begged with such hansom pity, that the Duke
Me thought stood staggering, whether •…e should follow
His ra•…h of the, or the sweet compassion
Of those two 〈◊〉; and to second them,
That truly noble Prince P•…rithous
Half his own heart, set in too, that I hope
All shall be well: Neither heard I one question
Of your name, or his scope.
Pray heaven it hold so.
Be of good comfort man; I bring you news,
Good news.
They are welcome,
Palamon has cleared you,
And got your pardon, and discovered
How, and by whose means he escaped, which was your Daughters,
Whose pardon is procured too, and the Prisoner
Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness,
Has given a sum of money to her Marriage.
A large one isle assure you.
Ye are a good man
And ever bring good news.
How was it ended?
Why, as it should be; they that nev'r begged
But they prevailed, had their suites fairly granted,
The prisoners have their lives.
I knew t'would be so.
But there be new conditions, which you'll hear of
At better time.
I hope they are good.
They are honourable,
How good they'll prove, I know not.
T'will be known.
Alas Sir, wher's your Daughter?
Why doe you ask?
O Sir when did you see her?
How he looks?
This morning.
Was she well? was she in health? Sir, when did she sleep?
These are strange Questions.
I doe not think she was very well, for now
You make me mind her, but this very day
I asked her questions, and she answered me
So far from what she was, so childishly.
So sillily, as if she were a fool,
An Inocent, and I was very angry.
But what of her Sir?
Nothing but my pity; but you must know it, and as good by me
As by an other that less loves her:
Well Sir.
Not right?
Not well? — Wooer, No Sir not well.
Tic too true, she is mad.
It cannot be.
Believe you'll find it so.
I half suspected
What you told me: the gods comfort her:
Either this was her love to Palamon,
Or fear of my miscarrying on his scope,
Or both.
Tic likely.
But why all this haste Sir?
Isle tell you quickly. As I late was angling
In the great Lake that lies behind the Palace,
From the far shore, thick set with reeds, and Sedges,
As patiently I was attending sport,
I heard a voice, a shrill one, and attentive
I gave my ear, when I might well perceive
T'was one that sung, and by the smallness of it
A boy or woman. I then left my angle
To his own skill, came near, but yet perceivd not
Who made the sound; the rushes, and the Reeds
Had so encompassed it: I laid me down
And listened to the words she song, for then
Through a small glade cut by the Fi•…her men,
I saw it was your Daughter.
Pray go on Sir?
She sung much, but no sense; on•…lie I heard her
Repeat this often. Palamon is gone,
Is gone to'th wood to gather Mulberries,
Isle find him out to morrow.
Pretty soul.
His shackles will betray him, he will be taken,
And what shall I doe then? Isle bring a •…eavy,
A hundred black eyd Maids, that love as I doe
With Chaplets on their heads of Daffodils,
With cherry-lips, and cheeks of Damask Rofes,
And all we'll dance an Antique fore the Duke,
And beg his pardon; Then she talked of you Sir;
That you must loose your head to morrow morning,
And she must gather flowers to bury you,
And see the house made handsome, then she sung
Nothing but Willow, willow, willow, and between
Ever was, Palamon, fair Palamon,
And Palamon, was a tall young man. The 〈◊〉
Was knee deep where she sat; her careless Tresses,
A wreak of bull-rush rounded; about her stuck
Thousand fresh water flowers of several colours.
That me thought she appeared like the fair Nymph
That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris
Newly dropped down from heaven; Rings she made
Of rushes that grew by, and to 'em spoke
The prettiest posies: Thus our truelove's tide,
This you may loose, not me, and many a one:
And then she wept, and s•…ng again, and sighed,
And with the same breath smiled, and ki•… her hand.
Alas what pity it is?
I made in to her.
She saw me, and s•…raight sought the stood, I saved her,
And set her safe to land: when presently
She slipped away, and to the Go•…tie made,
With such a •…rye, and 〈◊〉, that 〈◊〉 me
She left me far behind her; 〈◊〉, 〈◊◊〉,
I saw from far off cross her 〈◊◊〉
I knew to be your brother, where 〈◊〉 staid,
And fell, scarce to be got away: I left them with her. 
And hither came to tell you: Here they are.
May you never more 〈◊〉 the light, &amp;c.
Is not this a fine Song?
O a very fine one.
I can •…ing twenty more.
I think you can,
Yes truly can I, I c•…n sing the Broom,
And Bony Robin. Are not you a tailor?
Yes,
Wher's my wedding Gown?
Isle bring it to morrow.
Doe, very rarely, I must be abroad else
To call the Maids, and pay the Minstrels
For I must loose my Maidenhead by cocklight
Twill never th•…iv else.
You must even take it patiently.
Tic true,
Good'ev'n, good men, pray did you ever hear
Of one young Palamon?
Yes wench we know him.
Is it not a fine young Gentleman?
Tic, Love.
By no mean cross her, she is then distempered
For worse then now she shows.
Yes, he's a fine man.
O, is he so? you have a Sister.
Yes.
But she shall never have him, tell her so,
For a trick that I know, you'd best look to her,
For if she see him once, she's gone, she's done,
And undone in an hour. All the young Maids
Of our Town are in love with him, but I laugh at'em
And let 'em all alone, Is it not a wise course?
Yes.
There is at least two hundred now with child by him,
There must befowre; ye•… I keep close for all this,
Close as a Cockle; and all these must be Boys,
He has the trick on it, and at ten years old
They must be all 〈◊〉 for 〈◊〉,
And sing the wars of Thesem.
This is strange.
As ever you heard, but say nothing.
No.
They come from all parts of the Dukedom to him,
Isle warrant ye, he had not so few last night
As twenty to dispatch, he will tickl't up
In two hours, if his hand be in.
She's lost
Past all cure.
Heaven forbid man.
Come hither, you are a wise man.
Do's she know him?
No, would she did.
You are master of a Ship?
Yes.
Wher's your Cömpasse?
Here.
Set it too'th North.
And now direct your conrse to'th wood, where Palamon
Lies longing for me; For the Tackling
Let me alone; Come weigh my hearts, cheerely.
Owgh, owgh, owgh, tic up, the wind's fair, top the
Bowling, out with the maine sail, wher's your
Whistle Master?
Lets get her in.
Up to the top Boy.
Wher's the Pilot?
Here,
What ken'st thou?
A fair wood.
Bear for it master: take about:
Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open
And bleed to death for my sake else; Isle choose,
And end their strife: Two such young hansom men
Shall never fall for me, their weeping Mothers,
Following the dead cold ashes of their Sons
Shall never curse my cruelty: Good heaven,
What a sweet face has Arcite? if wise nature
With all her best endowments, all those beauties
She sows into the births of noble bodies,
Were here a mortal woman, and had in her
The coy denials of young Maids, yet doubtless,
She would run mad for this man: what an eye?
Of what a fyry sparkle, and quick sweetness,
Has this young Prince? Here Love himself sits smiling,
Just such another wanton Ganimead,
Set Love a fire with, and enforcd the god
Snatch up the goodly Boy, and set him by him
A shining constellation: What a brow,
Of what a spacious Majesty he carries?
Arched like the great eyd Iuno's, but far sweeter,
Smoother then Pelops Shoulder? Fame and honour
Mc thinks from hence, as from a Promontory
Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings, and sing
To all the under world, the Loves, and Fights
Of gods, and sueh men neere'em. Palamon,
Is but his foil, to him, a mere dull shadow,
Hoe's swarth, and meagre, of an eye as heavy
As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,
No stirring in him, no alacrity,
Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile;
Yet these that we count errors may become him:
Narcissu•… was a sad Boy, but a heavenly:
Oh who can find the bent of women's fancy?
I am a Fool, my reason is lost in me,
I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly
That women ought to beat me. On my knees
I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone,
And only beautiful, and these the eyes,
These the bright lamps of beauty, that command
And threaten Love, and what young Maid dare cross 'em
What a bold gravity, and yet inviting
Has this browne manly face? O Love, this only
From this hour is Complexion: Lye there Arcite,
Thou art a changeling to him, a mere Gypsy.
And this the noble Body: I am sotted,
Utterly lost: My Virgins faith has fled me.
For if my brother but even now had asked me
Whether I loved, I had run mad for Arcite,
Now if my Sister; More for Palamon,
Stand both together: Now, come ask me Brother,
Alas, I know not: ask me now sweet Sister,
I may go look; What a mere child is Pansy,
That having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,
Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both.
How now Sir?
From the Noble Duke your Brother
Madam, I bring you news: The Knights are come.
To end the quarrel?
Yes.
Would I might end first:
What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,
That my unspotted youth must now be soiled
With blood of Princes? and my Chastity
Be made the Altar, where the lives of Lovers,
Two greater, and two better never yet
Made mothers joy, must be the sacrifice
To my unhappy Beauty?
Bring 'em in quickly,
By any means, I long to see'em.
Your two contending Lovers are returned,
And with them their fair Knights: Now my fair Sister,
You must love one of them.
I had rather both,
So neither for my sake should fall untimely
Who saw'em?
I a while.
And I.
From whence come you Sir?
From the Knights.
Pray speak
You that have seen them, what they are.
I will Sir,
And truly what I think: Six braver spirits
Then these they have brought, (if we judge by the outside)
I never saw, nor read of: He that stands
In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming
Should be a stout man, by his face a Prince,
(His very looks so say him) his complexion,
Nearer a browne, than black; sterne, and yet noble,
Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers:
The circles of his eyes show fair within him,
And as a heated Lyon, so he looks;
His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining
Like Ravens wings: his shoulders broad, and ftrong,
Armed long and round, and on his Thigh a Sword
Hung by a curious Baldrick; when he frowns
To seal his will with, better o'my conscience
Was never Soldiers friend.
Thou hast well described him.
Yet a great deal short
Me thinks, of him that's first with Palamon.
Pray speak him friend.
I guess he is a Prince too,
And if it may be, greater; for his show
Has all the ornament of honour in it:
Hoe's somewhat bigger, then the Knight he spoke of,
But of a face far sweeter; His complexion
Is (as a ripe grape) ruddy: he has felt
Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter
To make this cause his own: In's face appears
All the fai•…e hopes of what he undertakes,
And when he's angry, then a settled valour
(Not tainted with extremes) runs through his body,
And guides his arm to brave things: Fear he cannot,
He shewesno such soft temper, his head's yellow,
Hard haired, and curled, thick twinned like Ivy tops,
Not to undo with thunder: In his face
The livery of the warlike Maid appears,
Pure red, and white, for yet no beard has bleft him.
And in his rolling eyes, 〈◊〉 victory.
As if she ever meant to correct his valour:
His Nose stands high, a Character of honour.
His red lips, after fights, are fit for Ladies.
Must these men die too?
When he speaks, his tongue
Sounds like a Trumpet; All his lineaments
Are as a man would wish 'em, strong, and clean,
He wears a well-steeld Axe, the staff of gold,
His age some five and twenty.
Ther's another,
A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming
As great as any: fairer promises
In such a Body, yet I never looked on.
O, he that's freckle faced?
The same my Lord,
Are they not sweet ones?
Yes they are well.
Me thinks,
Being so few, and well disposed, they show
Great, and fine art in nature, he's white haired,
Not wanton white, but such a manly colour
Next to an aborne, tough, and nimble set,
Which shows an active soul; his arms are brawny
Lined with strong sine was: To the shoulder piece,
Gently they swell, like women new conceived,
Which speaks him prone to labour, never fainting
Under the weight of Arms; stout hearted, still,
But when he stirs, a Tiger; he's gray eyd,
Which yields compassion where he conquers: sharpe
To spy advantages, and where he finds 'em,
He's swift to make 'em his: He do's no wrongs,
Nor takes none; he's round faced, and when he smiles
He shows a Lover, when he frowns, a Soldier:
About his head he wears the winners ok,
And in it stuck the favour of his Lady:
His age, some six and thirty. In his hand
He bears a charging Staff, embossed with silver.
Are they all thus?
They are all the sons of honour.
Now as I have a soul I long to see'em,
Lady you shall see men fight now.
I wish it,
But not the cause my Lord; They would show
Bravely about the Titles of two Kingdoms;
Tic pity Love should be so tyrannous:
O my soft hearted Sister, what think you?
Weep not, till they weep blood; Wench it must be.
You have steel'd'em with your Beauty: honoured Friend,
To you I give the Field; pray order it,
Fitting the persons that must use it.
Yes Sir.
Come, 〈◊〉 go visit'em: I cannot stay.
Their fame has fired me so; Till they appear,
Good Friend be royal.
There shall want no bravery.
Poor wench go weep, for whosoever wins,
Looses a noble Cousin, for thy sins.
Her distraction is more at some time of the Moon,
〈◊〉 at other some, is it not?
She is continually in a harmless distemper, sleeps
Little, altogether without appetite, save often drinking,
Dreaming of another world, and a better; and what
Broken piece of matter so'ere she's about, the name
Palamon lardes it, that she 〈◊〉 every business 
Withal, fits it to every question; Look where
〈◊〉 comes, you shall perceive her behaviour.
I have forgot it quite; The burden o'nt, was down
A down a, and pend by no worse man, then
Gerald, Emilias Schoolmaster; he's as
Fantastical too, as ever he may go upon's legs,
For in the next world will Dido see Palamon, and
Then will she be out of love with 〈◊〉.
What stuff's here? pore soul.
Even thus all day long.
Now for this Charm, that I told you of, you must
Bring a piece of silver on the tip of your tongue,
Or no feiry: then if it be your chance to come where
The blessed spirits, as the'rs a sight now; we maids
That have our Livers, perished, cracked to pieces with
Love, we shall come there, and doe nothing all day long
But pick flowers with Proserpine, then will I make
Palamon a Nosegay, then let him mark me, — then.
How prettily she's amiss? note her a little further.
Faith isle tell you, sometime we go to Barley break,
We of the blessed; alas, tic a sore life they have in the
Tother place, such burning, frying, boiling, hissing,
Howling, chattering, cursing, oh they have shroud
Measure, take heed; if one be mad, or hang or
Drown themselves, thither they go, Iupiter bless
Vs, and there shall we be put in a Cauldron of
Lead, and Usurers grease, amongst a whole million of
Cutpurses, and there boyle like a Gamon of Bacon
That will never be enough.
How her brain coins?
Lords and Courtiers, that have got maids with
Child, they are in this place, they shall stand in fire up to the
Nav'le, and in ice up to'th hart, and there th'offending part burns, and the deceiving part freezes; in troth a very gre∣vous punishment, as one would think, for such a Trifle, be∣leve me one would marry a leprous witch, to be rid on it Isle assure you.
How she continues this fancy? Tic not an engraffed
Madness, but a most thick, and profound melancholy.
To hear there a proud Lady, and a proud City
wife, howl together: I were a beast and il'd call it good
sport: one cries, o this smoke, another this fire; One cries, o,
that ever I did it behind the arras, and then howls; the other
curses a suing fellow and her garden house.
〈◊〉. I will be true, my stars, my fate, &amp;c.
What think you of her Sir?
I think she has a perturbed mind, which I cannot minister to.
Alas, what then?
Understand you, she ever affected any man, ere
She beheld Palamon?
I was once Sir, in great hope, she had fixed her
Liking on this gentleman my friend.
I did think so too, and would account I had a great
Pen-worth on it, to give half my slate, that both
She and I at this present stood unfeignedly on the
Same terms.
That intemprat surfeit of her eye, hath distempered the
Other senses, they may return and settle again to
Execute their preordaind faculties, but they are
Now in a most extravagant vagary. This you
Must doe, Confine her to a place, where the light
May rather seem to steal in, then be permitted; take
Upon you (young Sir her friend) the name of
Palamon, say you come to eat with her, and to
Commune of Love; this will catch her attention, for
This her mind beats upon; other objects that are
Inserted tweene her mind and eye, become the pranks
And friskins of her madness; Sing to her, such greene
Songs of Love, as she says Palamon hath sung in
Prison; Come to her, stuck in as sweet flowers, as the
Season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of
Some other compounded odours, which are grateful to the
Sense: all this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can
Sing, and Palamon is sweet, and every good thing, desire
To eat with her, crave her, drink to her, and still
Among, intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance
Into her favour: Learn what Maids have been her
Companions, and play-pheeres, and let them repair to
Her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with
Tokens, as if they suggested for him, It is a falsehoód
She is in, which is with fasehoods to be combated.
This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what's
Now out of square in her, into their former law, and
Regiment; I have seen it approved, how many ti•…s
I know n•…t, but to make the number more, I have
Great hope in this. I will between the passages of
This project, come in with my appliance: Let us
Put it in execution; and hasten the success, which doubt not
Will bring forth comfort.
Now let'em enter, and before the gods
Tender their holy prayers: Let the Temples
Burn bright with sacred fires, and the Altars
In hallowed clouds commend their swelling Incense
To those above us: Let no due be wanting, 
They have a noble work in hand, will honour
The very powers that love 'em.
Sir they enter.
You valiant and strong hearted Enemies
You royal German foes, that this day come
To blow that nearness out that flames between ye;
Lay by your anger for an hour, and dove-like
Before the holy Altars of your helpers
(The all feared gods) bow down your stubborn bodies,
Your ire is more than mortal; So your help be,
And as the gods regard ye, fight with Justice,
I le leave you to your prayers, and betwixt ye
I part my wishes.
Honour crown the worthiest.
The glasso is running now that cannot finish
Till one of us expire: Think you but thus,
That were there ought in me which strove to show
Mine enemy in this business, were it one eye
Against another: Arm oppressed by Arm:
I would destroy th'offender, Cos, I would
Though parcel of my self: Then from this gather
How I should tender you.
I am in labour
To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred
Out of my memory; and in the self same place
To seat something I would confound: So hoist we
The sails, that must these vessels port even where
The heavenly Lymiter pleases.
You speak well;
Before I turn, Let me embrace thee Cousin
This I shall never doe again.
One farewell.
Why let it be so: Farewell Cos.
Farewell Sir;
Knights, Kinsemen, Lovers, ye•… my Sacrifices
True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you
Expels the seeds of fear, and th'apprehension
Which still is farther off it, Go with me
Before the god of our profession: There
Require of him the heart•… of Lyons, and
The breath of Tigers, yea the fierceness too,
Yea the speed also, to go on, I mean:
Else wish we to be Snails; you know my prize
Must be dragged out of 〈◊〉, force and great feat
Must put my Garland on, where she sticks
The Queen of Flowers: our intercession then
Must be to him that makes the Camp, a Cestron
Brymd with the blood of men: give me your aide
And bend your spirits towards him. 
Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turned
Greene Nepture into purple.
Comets prewarne, whose havoc in vast Field
Vnearthed skulls proclaim, whose breath blows down,
The teeming Ceres foison, who dost pluck
With hand armenypotent from forth blew clouds,
The •…asond Turrets, that both make, and break
The stony girths of Cities: me thy puple,
Youngest follower of thy Dro•…, 〈◊〉 this day
With military skill, that to thy lawed
I may advance my Streamer, and by thee,
Be styled the Lord of the day, give me great Mars
Some token of thy pleasure. 
O Great Corrector of enormous times;
Shaker of ore-rank States, thou grand decider
Of dusty, and old tytles, that healst with blood
The earth when it is sick, and cursed the world
Of the pleurisy of people; I doe take
Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name
To my design; march boldly, let us go•….
Our stars must glister with new fire, or be
To day extinct; our argument is love,
Which if the goddess of it grant, she gives
Victory too, then blend your spirits with mine,
You, whose free nobleness doe make my cause
Your personal hazard; to the goddess Uenus
Commend we our proceeding, and implore
Her power unto our party. 
Hail Sovereign Queen 〈◊〉, who hast power
To call the fiercest Tyrant from his rage;
And weep unto a Girl; that hast the might
Even with an ey-glance, to choke Marsis Drom
And turn th'allarme to whispers, that can make
A Cripple flourish with his Cr•…ch, and cure him
Before Apollo; that may force the King
To be his subjects vassal, and induce
Stale gravity to dance, the bold Bachelor
Whose youth like wanton Boys through Bonfires
Have skipped thy flame, at seventy, thou can catch
And make him to the scorn of his hoarse throat
Abuse young lays of love; what godlike power
Hast thou not power upon? To 〈◊〉 thou
Add flames, hotter then his the heavenly fires
Did scorch his mortal Son, thine him; the huntress
All moist and cold, some say began to throw
Her Bow away, and sigh: take to thy grace
Me thy vowed Soldier, who doe bear thy yoke
As it were a wreath of Roses, yet is heavier
Then Lead it self, stings more than Nettles;
I have never been foul mouthed against thy law,
Nev'r reveled secret, for I knew none; would not
Had I kend all that were; I never practised
Upon mans wife, nor would the Libels read
Ofliberall wits: I never at great feasts
Sought to betray a Beauty, but have blushed
At simpering Sirs that did: I have been harsh
To large •…onfessors, and have hotly asked them
If they had Mothers, I had one, a woman,
And women it were they wronged. I knew a man
Of eighty winters, this I told them, who
A Lass of fourteen breded, it was thy power
To put life into dust, the aged Cramp
Had screwed his square foot round,
The Gout had knit his fingers into knots,
Torturing Convulsions from his globe eyes,
Had almost drawn their spheres, that what was life
In him seemed torture: this Anatomy
Had by his young fair fear a Boy, and I
Believed it was his, for she swore it was,
And who would not believe her? brief I am
To those that prate and have done; no Companion
To those that boast and have not; a defyer
To those that would and cannot; a Rejoycer,
Yea him I doe not love, that tells close offices
The foulest way, nor names concealments in
The boldest language, such a one I am,
And vow that lover never yet made sigh
Truer then I. O then most soft sweet goddess
Give me 〈◊〉 victory of this question, which
Is true loves merit, and bless me with a sign
Of thy great pleasure.
O thou that from eleven, to ninety raign'st
In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world
And we in herds thy game; I give thee thanks
For this fair Token, which being laid unto
Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance 
My body to this business. Let us rise
And bow b•…ore the goddess: Time comes on.
O sacred, sh•…dow, cold and constant Queen,
Abandoner of Revels, mute contemplative,
Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure
As windefand Snow, who to thy female knights
Allow no more blood than will make a blush,
Which is their orders robe. I here thy Priest
Am humbled fore thine Altar, O vouchsafe
With that thy rare greene eye, which never yet
Bah•…d thing maculate, look on thy virgin,
And sacred silver Mistress, lend hen ear
(Which 〈◊〉 heard scurrill term, into whose port
Ne'er entered wanton sound,) to my petition
Second wi•…h ho•…y fear; This is my last
Of vestal office, I am 〈◊〉 habitat,
But maid•…n hearted, a husband I have poin•…ed,
But doe not know him out of two, I should
Choose one, and pray for his success, but I
Am guiltless of election of mine eyes,
Were I to loose one, they are equal precious,
I could doombe neither, that which perished should
Go too't unsentenc'd: Therefore most modest Queen,
He of the two Pretenders, that best loves me
And has the truest ti•… in it, Let him
Take off my wheaten Garland, or else grant
The fyle and qualitiel hold, I may
Continue in thy Band. 
See what our General of Ebbs and Flows
Out from the bowels of her holy Altar
With sacred act advances: But one Rose,
If well inspird, this Battle shall confound
Both these brave Knights, and I a virgin flower
Must grow alone unpl•…ck'd. 
The flower is fallen, the Tree descends: O Mistress
Thou here dischargest me, I shall be gathered,
I think so, but I know not thine own will;
Vnclaspe thy Mystery: I hope she's pleased,
Her Signs were gracious.
Has this advice I told you, done any good upon her?
O very much; The maids that hept her company
Have half persuaded her that I am Palamon; within this
Half hour she came smiling to me, and asked me what I
Would cate, and when I would kiss her: I told her
Presently, and kissed her twice.
T was well done; twenty times had bin far better,
For there the cure lies •…inely.
Then she told me
She would watch with me to night, for well she knew
What hour my fit would take me.
Let her do•… so,
And when your fit comes, fit her home,
And presently.
She would have me sing.
You did so?
No.
It was very i•…l done then,
You should observe her every way.
Alas
I have no voice Sir, to confirm her that way.
That's all one, if ye make a noise,
If she entreat again, doe any thing,
Lye with her if she ask you.
Hoe there Doctor.
Yes in the way of cure.
But first by your leave
In the way of honesty.
That's but a niceness,
Nev'r cast your child away for honesty;
Cure her first this way, then if shoe will be honest,
She has the path before her.
Thank ye Doctor.
Pray bring her in
And let's see how she is.
I will, and tell her
Her Falam•…n stays for her: But Doctor,
Me thinks you are in the wrong still.
•…o, go: you Fathers are fine Fools: her honesty?
And we should give her physic till we find that:
Why, doe you think she is not honest Sir?
How old is she?
She's eighteen.
She may be,
But that's all one, tic nothing to our purpose,
What ere her Father says, if you perceive
Her mood inclining that way that I spoke of
Videlicet, the way of flesh, you have me.
Yet very well Sir.
Please her appetite
And doe it home, it cures her ips•… facto,
The melancholy humour that infects her.
I am of your mind Doctor.
You'll find it so; she comes, pray honour her.
Come, your Love Palamon stays for you child,
And has done this long hour, to visit you.
I thank him for his gen•…le patience,
He's a kind Gentleman, and I am much bound to him,
Did you nev'r see the horse he gave me?
Yes.
How doe you like him?
He's a very fair one.
You never saw him dance?
No.
I have often.
He dances very finely, very comely,
And for a Jig, come cut and long tail to him,
He turns ye like a Top.
That's fine indeed.
He will dance the Morris twenty mile an hour,
And that will founder the best hobby-horse
(If I have any skill) in all the parish,
And gallops to the turn of Light a'love,
What think you of this horse?
Having these virtues
I think he might be brought to play at Tennis.
Alas that's nothing.
Can he write and read too.
A very fair hand, and casts himself th'accounts
Of all his hay and provender: That Hostler
Must rise betime that cozens him; you know
The Chestnut Mare the Duke has?
Very well.
She is horribly in love with him, poor beast,
But he is like his master coy and scornful.
What dowry has she?
Some two hundred Bottles,
And twenty strike of O•…s; but he will ne'er have h•…
He lisps in's neighing able to entice
A Millars Mare,
H•…l be the death of her.
What stuff she utters?
Make curtsy, here your love comes.
Pretty soul
How doe ye? that's a fine maid, ther's a curtsy.
Yours to command ith way of honesty;
How far is it now to'th end of the world my Masters?
Why a days Journey wench.
Will you go with m•…?
What shall we doe there wench?
Why play at stool ball.
What is there else to doe?
I am content
If we shall keep our wedding there.
Tic true
For there I will assure you, we shall find
Some blind Priest for the purpose, that will venture
To marry us, for here they are nice, and foolish;
Besides my father must be hanged to morrow
And that would be a blot in the 〈◊〉
Are not you Palamon?
Doe not you know me?
Yes, but you care not for me; I have nothing
But this pore petticoat, and too corse Smocks.
That's all one, I will have you.
Will you surely?
Yes by this fair hand will I.
We'll to bed then.
Even when you will.
O Sir, you would fine be nibbling.
Why doe you rub my kiss off?
Tic a sweet one,
And will perfume me finely against the wedding.
Is not this your Cousin Arcite?
Yes sweetheart,
And I am glad my Cousin Palamon
Has made so fair a choice.
Doe you think he will have me?
Yes without doubt.
Doe you think so too?
Yes.
We shall have many children: Lord, how you're grown,
My Palamon I hope will grow too finely
Now he's at liberty: Alas poor Chicken
He was kept down with hard meat, and ill lodging
But isle kiss him up again.
What doe you here, you'll loose the noblest sight
That ev'r was seen.
Are they in the Field?
They are
You bear a charge there too.
Isle away straight
I must even leave you here.
Nay we'll go with you,
I will not loose the Fight.
How did you like her?
Isle warrant you within these 3. or 4 days
Isle make her right again. You must not from her
But still preserve her in this way.
I will,
Lets get her in.
Come sweet we'll go to dinner
And then weal play at Cards.
And shall we kiss too?
A hundréd times
And twenty.
I and twenty.
And then we'll sleep together.
Take her offer.
Yes marry will we.
But you shall not hurt me.
I will not sweet.
If you doe (Love) isle cry.
Isle no step further.
Will you loose this sight?
I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly
Then this decision every; blow that falls
Threats a brave life, each str•…ache laments
The place whereon it false, and sounds more like
A Bell, then blade: I will stay here,
It is enough my hearing shall be punished,
With what shall happen, against the which there is
No deafening, but to hear; not taint mine eye
With dread sights, it may shun.
Sir, my good Lord
Your Sister will no further.
Oh she must.
She shall see deeds of honour in their kind,
Which sometime show well pencild. Nature now
Shall make, and act the Story, the belief
Both sealed with eye, and ear; you must be present,
You are the victors mead, the price, and garlond
To crown the Questions title.
Pardon me,
If I were there, I'd wink
You must be there;
This Trial is as it were in the night, and you
The only star to shine.
I am extinct,
There is but envy in that light, which shows
The one the other: darkness which ever was
The dam of horror, who do's stand accursed
Of many mortal Millions, may even now
By casting her black mantle over both
That neither could find other, get her self
Some part of a good name, and many a murder
Set off where she's guilty.
You must go.
In faith I will not.
Why the knights must kindle
Their valour at your eye: know of this war
You are the Treasure, and must needs be by
To give the Service pay.
Sir pardon me,
The title of a kingdom may be tried
Out of it self.
Well, well then, at your pleasure,
Those that remain with you, could wish their office
To any of their Enemies.
Farewell Sister,
I am like to know your husband fore your self
By some small start of time, he whom the gods
Doe of the two know best, I pray them he
Be made your Lot.
Arcite is gently visagd; yet his eye
Is like an Engine bent, or a sharpe weapon
In a sustained sheath; mercy, and manly courage
Are bedfellows in his visage: Palamon
Has a most menacing aspect, his brow
Is graved, and seems to bury what it frowns on,
Yet sometime tic not so, but alters to
The quality of his thoughts; long time his eye
Will dwell upon his object. Melancholy
Becomes him nobly; So do's Arcites mirth,
But Palamons sadness is a kind of mirth,
So mingled, as if mirth did make him sad,
And sadness, merry; those darker humours that
Stick misbecomingly on others, on them
Live in fair dwelling. 
Hark how you spurs to spirit doe incite
The Princes to their proof, Arcite may win me,
And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to
The spoiling of his figure. O what pity
Enough for such a chance; if I were by
I might doe hurt, for they would glance their eyes
Toward my Seat, and in that motion might
Omit a ward, or forfeit an offence
Which craved that very time: it is much better
(Cornets. a great cry and noise within crying a Palamon.)
I am not there, oh better never born•…
Then minister to such harm, what is the chance?
The Crie's a Palamon.
Then he has won: It was ever likely,
He looked all grace and success, and he is
Doubtless the prim'st of men: I prithee run
And tell me how it goes.
Still Palamon.
Run and enquire, poor Servant thou hast lost,
Upon my right side still I wore thy picture,
Palamons on the le•…, why so, I know not,
I had no end in it; else chance would have it so. 
On the sinister side, the heart lies; Palamon
Had the best boding chance: This burst of clamour
Is sure th'end of the Combat.
They said that Palamon had Arcites body
Within an inch of the Pyramid, that the cry
Was general a Palamon: But anon,
The Assistants made a brave redemption, and
The two bold Tytlers, at this instant are
Hand to hand at it.
Were they metamorphisd
Both into one; oh why? there were no woman
Worth so composed a Man: their single share,
Their nobleness peculiar to the•…, gives
The prejudice of disparity values shortness 
To any Lady breathing — More exulting?
Palamon still?
Nay, now the sound is Arcite.
I prithee lay attention to the Cry.
 Set both thine •…ares to'th business.
The cry is
Arcite, and victory, hark Arcite, victory,
The Combats consummation is proclaimed
By the wind Instruments.
Half sights saw
That Arcite was no babe: god's lyd, his richness
And costliness of spirit looked through him, it could
No more be hid in him, then fire in flax,
Then humble banks can go to law with waters,
That drift winds, force to raging: I did think
Good Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew not
Why I did think so; Our reasons are not prophets
When oft our fancies are: They are coming off:
Alas poor Palamon.
Lo, where our Sister is in expectation,
Yet quaking, and unsettled: Fairest Emily.
The gods by their divine arbitrament
Have given you this Knight, he is a good one
As ever struck at head: Give me your hands;
Receive you her, you him, be plighted with
A love that grows, as you decay;
Emily,
To buy you, I have lost what's dearest to me,
Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply,
As I doe rate your value.
O loved Sister,
He speaks now of as brave a Knight as ere
Did spur a noble Steed: Surely the gods
Would have him die a Bachelor, least his race
Should show in the world too godlike: His behaviour
So char•…d me, that me thought Alcides was
To him a sow of lead: if I could praise
Each part of him to'th all; I have spoke, your Arcut•…
Did not loose by it; For he that was thus good
Encountered yet his Better, I have heard
Two emulous Philomels, beat the care of the night
With their contentious throats, now one the higher,
Anon the other, then again the first,
And by and by out breasted, that the sense
Could not be judge between 'em: So it fared
Good space between these kinesmen; till heavens did
Make hardly one the winner: wear the Girlond
With joy that you have won: For the subdued,
Give them our present Justice, since I know
Their lives but pinch'em; Let it here be done:
The Scene's not for our seeing, go we hence,
Right joyful, with some sorrow. Arm your prize,
I know you will not loose her: Hipolita
I see one eye of yours conceives a tear
The which it will deliver.
Is this winning?
Oh all you heavenly powers where is you mercy?
But that your wills have said it must be so,
And charge me live to comfort this unfriended,
This miserable Prince, that cuts away
A life more worthy from him, then all women;
I should, and would die too.
Infinite pity
That four such eyes should be so fixed on one
That two must needs be blind fort.
So it is.
Ther's many a man alive, that hath out lived
The love of the people, yea in the selfsame state
Stands many a Father with his child; some comfort
We have by so considering: we expire
And not without men's pity. To live still,
Have their good wishes, we prevent
The loathsome misery of age, beguile
The Gout and Rheum, that in lag hours attend
For grey approachers; we come towards the gods
Young, and unwapper'd not, halting under Cry•…es
Many and stale: that sure shall please the gods
Sooner than such, to give us Nectar with 'em,
For we are more clear Spirits. My dear kinsemen.
Whose lives (for this poor comfort) are laid down,
You have sold 'em too too cheap.
What ending could be
Of more content? ore us the victors have
Fortune, whose title is as momentary,
As to us death is certain: A grain of honour
They not ore'-weigh us.
Let us bid farewell;
And with our patience, anger tottring Fortune,
Who at her certain'st reels.
Come? who begins?
Even he that led you to this Banquet, shall
Taste to you all: ah ha my Friend, my Friend,
Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;
You'll see it done now for ever: pray how does she?
I heard she was not well; her kind of ill
gave me some sorrow.
Sir she's well restored,
And to be married shortly.
By my short life
I am most glad on it; Tic the latest thing
I shall be glad of, prithee tell her so:
Commend me to her, and to piece her portion
Tender her this.
Nay lets be offerers all.
Is it a maid?
Verily I think so,
A right good creature, more to me deserving
Then I can quite or speak of.
Commend us to her.
The gods requight you all,
And make her thankful.
Adieu; and let my life be now as short,
As my leave taking.
Lead couragiour Cousin.
Wec'l follow cheerfully.
Hold, hold, O hold, hold, hold.
Hold hoe: It is a cursed hast you 〈◊〉
If you have done so quickly: noble Palamon,
The gods will show their glory in a life.
That thou art yet to lead.
Can that be,
When Venus I have said is false? How doe things fare?
Arise great Sir, and give the tidings 〈◊〉
That are most early sweet, and bitter.
What
Hath waked us from our dream?
List then: your Cousin
Mounted upon a Steed that Emily
Did first bestow on him, a black one, owing
Not a hair 〈◊〉 of white, which some will say
Weakens his 〈◊〉, and many will not buy
His goodness with this note: Which superstition
〈◊〉 finds allowance: On this horse is Arcite
Trotting the stones of Athens, which the Calkins
Did rather tell, then trample; for the horse
Would make his length a mile, if it pleased his Rider
To put pride in him: as he thus went counting
The flinty pavement, dancing as it were to'th Music
His own 〈◊〉 made; (for as they say 〈◊〉 iron
Came Musickes origin) what 〈◊〉 Flint,
Cold as old Saturn, and like him possessed
With fire male volent, darted a Spark
Or what fierce sulphur else, to this end 〈◊〉,
I comment 〈◊〉; the hot horse, hot as fire
Took Toy at this, and fell to what disorder
His power could give his will, bounds, comes on end,
Forgets school doing, being therein trained,
And of kind mannadge, pig-like he whines
At the sharpe Rowel, which he frets at rather
Then any jot obeys; seeks all foul means
Of boisterous and rough Iadrie, to dis-seate
His Lord, that kept it bravely: when nought served,
When neither Curb would crack, girth break nor differing plunges
Dis-roote his Rider whence he grew, but that
He kept him tweene his legs, on his hind hooves on end he stands
That Arcites legs being higher then his head
Seemed with strange art to hang: His victoros wreath
Even then fell off his head: and presently
Backward the lade comes ore, and his full poyze
Becomes the Riders load: yet is he living.
But such a vessel 〈◊〉, that floats but for
The surge that next approaches: he much desires
To have some speech with you: Lo he appears. 
O miserable end of our alliance
The gods are 〈◊〉 Arcite, if thy heart,
Thy worthy, manly heart be yet unbroken;
Give me thy last words, I am Palamon,
One that yet loves thee dying.
Take Emilia
And with her, all the worlds joy: Reach thy hand,
Farewell: I have told my last hour; I was false,
Yet never treacherous: Forgive me Cousin:
One 〈◊〉 from fair Emilia: Tic done:
Take her: I die.
Thy brave soul 〈◊〉 Elikium.
Isle close thine eyes Prince; blessed souls be with thee,
Thou art a right good man, and while I live,
This day I give to tears.
And I to honour.
In this place first you fought: even very here
I sundried you, acknowledge to the gods
Our thanks that you are living:
His part is played, and though it were too short
He did it well: your day is lengthned, and,
The blissful dew of heaven do's arouse you.
The powerful 〈◊〉, well hath graced her Altar,
And given you your love: Our Master Mars
Hast vouched his Oracle, and to Arcite gave
The grace of the Contention: So the Deities
Have showed due justice: Bear this hence.
O Cousin,
That we should things desire, which doe cost us
The loss of our desire; That nought could buy
Dear love, but loss of dear love.
Never 〈◊〉
Did play a subtler 〈◊〉: The conquered triumphs,
The victor has the Loss: yet in the passage,
The gods have been most equal: Palamon,
Your kinseman hath confessed the right of the Lady
Did lye in you, for you first saw her, and
Even then proclaimed your fancy: He restored her
As your stolen Jewel, and desired your spirit
To send him hence forgiven; The gods my justice
Take from my hand, and they themselves become
The Executioners: Lead your Lady off;
And call your Lovers from the stage of death,
Whom I adopt my Friends. A day or two
Let us look sadly, and give grace unto
The Funeral of Arcite, in whose end
The visages of 〈◊〉 weal put on
And smile with Palamon; for whom an hour,
But one hour since, I was as dearly sorry,
As glad of Arcite: and am now as glad,
As for him sorry. O you heavenly Charmers,
What things you make of us? For what we lack
We laugh, for what we have, are sorry still,
Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful
For that which is, and with you leave dispute
That are above our question: Let's go off,
And bear us like the time:
I Would now ask ye how ye like the Play,
But as it is with School Boys, cannot say,
I am cruel fearful: pray yet stay a while,
And let me look upon ye: No man smile?
Then it goes hard I see; He that has
Loved a young handsome wench then, show his face:
Tic strange if none be here, and if he will
Against his Conscience let him hiss, and kill
Our Market: Tic in vain, I see to stay ye,
Have at the worst can come, then; Now what say ye?
And yet mistake me not: I am not bold
We have no such cause. If the tale we have told
(For tic no other) any way content ye)
(For to that honest purpose it was meant ye)
We have our end; and ye shall have ere long
I dare say many a better, to prolong
Your old loves to us: we, and all our might,
Rest at your service, Gentlemen, good night.
